Hanging around hoping to help others as I was helped early days.\n\nMis-diagnosed for 18 months  between October 2010-April 2012 -  original problems pains in shoulders/biceps. Because ESR was deemed satisfactory GCA/PMR discounted by GP. Diagnosed as frozen shoulder, and any resultant head/neck pains attributed to that. Worsening fatigue was attributed to age and caring for husband. No Pred taken therefore.\n\nCorrect diagnosis from Ophthalmologist in A&E after irrevocable sight loss in right eye following 4 days of sight disturbances, specifically blurriness in right eye - started at bottom of eye moving over rest of eye until no sight remaining.\n\nReadings at diagnosis  \u2013 ESR 58, CRP 26.2. \nStarted 80mg Pred.  Took 4 and half years to get to zero; total time of GCA 6 years approximately. \nExpected side effects from Pred, slightly raised BP levels, slightly raised glaucoma levels (no action required for either).\nSteroid induced (?) cataract on remaining eye successfully replaced October 2014 when at 6mg. Initial weight gain, lost at lower levels, and more significantly once off the steroids. \n\nWidowed in 2013 (on 46th Wedding Anniversary) which although not ideal in its timing fortunately did not seem to affect my recovery, no flares of GCA, although ESR was raised mainly due to excess stress over previous few months. Late hubby in HM Forces, I worked for MOD for 30 years. Two children, four grandchildren.\n\nFinally getting my life back post GCA and enjoying it to the best of my ability. Been to New Zealand three times to see daughter and family - 2014, 2017, 2024. Hope to make more in future.\n\nJuly 2018 had total knee replacement (left);  January 2019 total hip replacement (right); February 2020 total shoulder replacement (left). Not blaming steroids, had OA before GCA, and unfortunately a family trait on maternal side.\n\nLady in banner is Freyja, Viking Goddess.\n\nAs name suggests, I live in Dorset!

            "bio": "Hi, I live in Nova Scotia, Canada.  Diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica in June 2015, after more than a year of increasing pain.  Medical complications include subsequent discovery that I have what they call \"low bone mass\" although exercise, diet and supplements are improving that, and recently learned that sarcoidosis (discovered through biopsy when I was in my mid-thirties) may also have some relevance to my life today.  Have been at about 2 mg prednisone for about two years (writing this 2019) after initial start dose of 15 mg.  Update October '19 appear to be successfully approaching 1 mg.  Have had to slow down DSNS taper by doing each taper twice.  \nMarch 2020 tapering to zero, Zero is \"new dose\".  :)\nJune 2020 at zero pred.  \nMy PMR journey has been bookended by injuries to my right knee.  In 2014 I sustained a tibial plateau fracture.  A couple of months after returning to work I developed fullblown PMR symptoms although I was not diagnosed until 2015.  And I have just, 31/5/20, fallen (tripped over an object in my home, my stupidity) and smashed the knee down as hard as I could.  Nothing broken but hurt enough to need a brace for a couple of weeks.   As I'm retired now I won't be overdoing things too soon this time.  :)\nActually the other knee is the bad one, after an apparently minor twist.  May be headed to eventual knee replacement but I think the problem rests with treating it as though it was osteoarthritis when it was really a damaged ligament or tendon.  gradually healing now that I've changed my behaviour.  Much of info in my blog.  https://anhaga1.com/\nZero pred lasted a month, the final week of which brought return of PMR pain, which pred sorted.  Now back at 2 mg. :(\nEnd of January 2021, unprecedented flare preceded by dramatic rise in CRP.  Up to 10 mg, and in process of quick step down to about 5 mg.   Which has not worked so far (mid-Feb).\nSept 2021 at around 4 mg pred, to my chagrin.  However knee injuries have subsided and I can take proper walks again, good for the mental outlook!\nWill this saga ever end?  Interestingly I found after my Shingrix shot at end of July I found it easier to taper for a while.  I have recently had the second, five and a half months after the first, and am feeling pretty good.  Tapering to 2.5.  Another thing which happened was my doctor sent me for morning cortisol test and result (about 60 hours after last pred dose) was right in the middle of the normal range.  And CRP is lowest it's ever been, first time I was told it was normal (3 point something).  Did the adjuvant in Shingrix help?  Footnote to vaccines:  had Moderna as second booster and since then have been very comfortably at 2.5 mg pred and tapering to 2.  Very slow progress, but progress neverthless.  PfizerX3   had been pretty much non-events, but Moderna, unexpectedly, hit me much like Shingrix.  \nApril 2023. Had Pfizer \"Spring dose\" a couple of weeks ago. Hardly even aware where the shot went in. Current pred dose 1.5 seems okay so far. I would have preferred a non-mRNA vaccine this time but Novavax only option and it's incredibly inconvenient to access.  Did not want Moderna again. I suppose there's no connection really, but it seems a bit more than coincidence that inconsequential heart symptoms quite rapidly became concerning a short while after first Moderna booster.  I didn't think to make the connection until after having Moderna bivalent. Now at glacial pace I've been undergoing various tests and there's a referral to a cardiologist. This all got underway last June (2022) and in December I got diagnosis of aortic regurgitation, later slightly glossed by my GP when he said no one part of my heart seems worse than any other. I have a \"tired\" heart. So not willing to stress it any more than is good for it.  2024 not seen specialist yet. GP has referred me to someone else. (Note: 2nd Jan '25, no cardiologist visit yet. GP re-referred me to different specialist, but even that was seven months ago)\nMay be at zero pred, time will tell. Writing this mid May 2024 and have not taken pred since Feb 1st. But broke my wrist about ten days ago so not sure what will happen next. PMR developed after a (much less serious) tibial plateau fracture. \nEnd of November, 2024, PMR still in remission. But....\nI'm actually taking pred again in what I hope will be a successful way to deal with what appears to be sarcoid patches on my skin. The good part is since I started (5 mg, now 4, to continue reducing) no new patches have appeared, and it's a lot easier to take a pill than smear on ineffective too-weak hydrocortisone ointment.  The bad part is the said too-weak ointment still needs to be used on what I have, and those patches still exist though very slowly fading.  I really hope I won't need to ask for a prescription ointment, and I am tapering more slowly than instructed because I don't want to open the door again. \nIt was accidental that I realized what this skin thing was, because it had bothered me off and on for many years, it would come and go, usually with the help of a prescription ointment then followed up with a good skin cream, but it was not a problem all those years I was on pred!  Never any diagnosis given, just treated as an idiopathic rash.  (Sarcoidosis was diagnosed through biopsy of a lymph node when I was about 35, although I never thought I had any symptoms.)  It reappeared about two months after achieving pred zero, although somewhat timidly at first and started as very sensitive skin when I was on my final taper to half a mg and then off. I remembered it was when at that very same dose in 2020, just before an unsuccessful first fling with zero, that I was cutting all the labels out of my clothes! \n2 Jan, '25, starting a new pred protocol, 5 mg until skin cleared up completely, then a slow taper, hopefully back to 2 mg. Dr provided me with what should be generous enough prescription refills. (PMR remains quiescent!)"

I was a nurse and manager of a cancer support centre, mum to two young adults with live-in elderly relative, I was fit and active . I had also got over breast cancer surgery, radio therapy and chemo in 2004.  Life as I knew it just stopped over 48 hours and I never made it back to work which broke my heart but I\u2019m learning a different way. It\u2019s been a long process of reassessing, healing and self discovery. Feb 2020 I was on 0.5mg. Came off Pred Aug 2020. The after effects are muscle loss and tendiopathy which is being worked on with specific exercises. I also have lifelong cyclical neutropaenia (not connected to GCA or PMR) meaning my neutrophil count drops every three weeks possibly also autoimmune but they don\u2019t know.  \nI have been off Pred since Aug 2020 and my recovery has continued rather than ending with the Pred. My energy and adrenal function were slow to return and a few times I had to take a rescue dose of Pred for adrenal crisis. During this time however, I had Covid 8 times. I came off Pred during long Covid the first time. The 4th time July 2022 took 7 months of feeling really low physically for 7 months. None of these caused a flare of GCA. It has taken until April 2023 to feel like my muscles have started to repair after Pred for 3.5 years. This was a depressing surprise that muscle resilience didn\u2019t bounce back and that it is a long term project. Unrealistic expectations from medical messaging didn\u2019t help."

Recently added spinal fractures to my list of woes which they are saying is due to steroids, but I'm not convinced. It's been a bumpy PMR journey and I've had a few setbacks such as rheumatologists saying I was too young to have PMR, which is when luckily I found this forum as he was so wrong.  Still have it in 2025, 13+ years later which is another debunk of the 'it burns itself out in 2 years myth' doctors trot out.  As well as being on a high dose of steroids I'm now trialling Hydroxychloraquine whch seems to be helping. Before that tried Methotrexate injections which I reacted badly to, Leflunomide which was ineffective and also Sulfasalazine. Had depo-medrone steroid injections as an alternative to Pred for a few years with mixed success (probably) due to inexperienced rheumatologist.  Also had adrenal problems several times.  Used to volunteer on PMRGCAuk Helpline and still help run PMRGCAuk's Yorkshire support group.  My personal mission having had such a hard time is to improve our care and treatment and support others with PMR/LVV/GCA and now also want ot spread the word about lookingafter your bones before it's too late"

            "bio": "I was a 61yr old woman when diagnosed in MAY 2019. Started my working life as a nurse at 'Jimmys' in Leeds. Later, I did my B.Ed in special needs at Hull  and have spent the rest of my life working in the Early Years Foundation Stage of education. \nI've felt pretty much alone in muddling my way through this condition up to press and have been very unwell from side effects of steroids more than the actual condition.  I started off on 40mg prednisolone and I'm now down to 2.5mg. God willing, I'll be off the steroids by the end of the year. Having been off work for 15mths, I'm now hoping to return to my job as a nursery teaching assistant in Sept. It's been an incredibly scary journey but somehow I've found ways to get through the worst days and the awful symptoms & side effects of the steroids,  and discovered strategies that have helped me. If I can help anyone by sharing this information,  I'd be very glad to.\nOCT 2020- How naive was I?? Since writing the above paragraph I've definitely re-educated myself about this condition....with a little....no actually,  a lot!.....of help from more informed people on here! Biggest lessons learned....PMR usually 'active' much longer than you're told or want to believe. It's not a race to get off pred as quickly as possible...and respect both the condition and the medication because patience is the key! I'm currently back up to 7.5mg and doing things much more slowly!! I'm also back at work, in school and I'm being VERY careful to pace myself, but not always easy to judge it correctly,  so had a few blips....but so far, so good. Hope this alerts 'newbies' to be aware of some of the inaccurate advice medical professionals may give you!\nNOV 2020:- I've had a whole half term back in school with my 26 nursery class children,  and how joyful and therapeutic it's been. However,  the flipside of this is that the increase in physical activity has meant an increase in my steroid dose. What began as 2.5mg in Sep has now increased to 12.5mgt now! It was inevitable and expected but a 2nd lockdown has resulted in me being told to stay home for 4wks! Another knock back, but hey ho.....what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger!\nAPRIL 2021- Still not back at work. Currently on 10mg pred. Initially I was 'staying safe' as higher dose of steroids put me back into immuno-compromised category..... the higher dose also then made me feel unwell again, causing head pain, fatigue and the other usual suspects! \nI'm about to begin a 3rd and final attempt to return to work at the end of May but I do have concerns and reservations as I don't want to lose all the improvements in my health that have been gained only because I've not been working!!\nWatch this space!\nMAY 2021- With a very heavy heart, I've had to make the most difficult decision to give up working and I'm applying for medical retirement.  I simply can't work and stay well. Feel so sad but know it's for the best.\nOCT 2021- I'm now officially medically retired as of 2wks ago. I've had my 'goodbye assembly' at school and was incredibly emotional. The Head, the children and the parents, all said such kind things. \nI'm slowly beginning to adjust to life at home and feeling more positive and motivated to explore what the next chapter of my life may have in store for me! I'm able to focus completely on my own health & well-being now and I'm already feeling some benefits. It's been a challenging transition for me to manage but I'm looking forward to 'covid-safer' times when I'll be able to go into nursery again as a regular volunteer helper. There's much to look forward to as a new door opens. \nAPRIL 2022- Well, covid is still ever present and affecting many of the choices I make regarding where I go and who I see. Sadly, I've not felt it safe enough to go into school yet, particularly as covid just seems to be repeatedly infecting my colleagues over & over again! I'm definitely feeling more settled though with regard to being medically retired, and much more accepting of the situation now that I'm realising what a positive impact its having on my health.....knowing I can now choose what my day will entail based on how I'm feeling has removed all the pressure and stress that a demanding job working with a Nursery class of 24 under 5's can produce. If I'm awake all night (as often happens) I no longer fret about needing to get to sleep because I've to be up at 6.30am for work. If I have a bad day when I'm feeling particularly fatigued, achey or just generally unwell, I can rest for as long as necessary and not be anxious about having to ring in sick!!\nJust knowing I can now focus completely on my own health & well-being has facilitated a definite improvement on both my physical well-being and my mental well-being.  Don't misunderstand me....I still experience challenging days but now I have the time to manage them more effectively and make better choices.\nBack in Jan, I developed a severe case of Urticaria....an unpleasant itchy skin rash that manifested with raised, angry patches of hives all over my arms, chest, trunk, thighs & legs. It appeared completely out of the blue and my new (and very knowledgeable & sympathetic) GP explained that this happens as a result of an allergic reaction to something...I've yet to discover what!! To my complete horror,  I was advised to increase my steroids from the 6mg I was currently on up to 30mg!.... the antihistamines alone weren't improving things. However  within 3wks I was back down at 6mg and together with 2 types of high strength prescription antihistamines the rash began to diminish.  It took at least 6wks for my skin to fully recover and now I make sure I pay as much attention to my skin-health as my overall health. \nI'm about to taper from 5\u00bdmg of pred to 5mg in the next week and at the moment  my health is fairly stable and constant. I truly believe this is down to not working anymore, having hugely reduced stress levels and directing my focus onto 'looking after me'!!\nMAY 2022 - Today is 11th May and after a long 3yrs I've finally made it into school again! With no covid infections currently evident and a lovely Nursery garden for outdoor teaching I decided there would not be a better time to make a return to the Nursery class that's been such a big part of my life for the best part of 15yrs! I did not return as a teacher though....I returned as a volunteer helper! It was so joyful and upifting. I felt I was exactly where I was meant to be. .....and the best part was that I had none of those pressures, responsibilities or stressors that would normally accompany my job. The children were such good therapy  and I truly loved and embraced getting to know them all. How privileged, lucky and blessed am I to have had today!\nI definitely intend to go in every week when possible and although I'm definitely tired now, I feel as long as I have a few days afterwards to rest and chill, there's no reason why I can't volunteer again. \nPMR can sometimes feel cruel...even brutal at times but today has been another little triumph and re-affirmed my belief that many good things are still possible ....you just have to trust in the process.\nWatch this space to see how I get on!\nJuly 2022 - Well, I made it into school for 4wks before 2 of the Nursery staff tested positive for covid...again!! This meant I had to temporarily refrain from going in till all clear, but with the summer break upon us, this won't  be till Sept now. \nI've had a wonderful holiday in Devon and I'm now beginning my next taper from 5mg down to 4.5mg. (I've been stable on 5mg for approx 7wks.)\nDec 22 - My health has had a few minor 'glitches' which fortunately have been resolved fairly easily and I'm now on 4mg of prednisolone and feeling pretty good most of the time. \nApproximately 6wks ago though I had another covid booster.  It was the Pfizer 'combo' one and although I suffered no obvious, immediate adverse affects (as I had with my previous Moderna one) I noticed that over the following 2wks my palpitations were beginning to re-emerge.  I have always had a history of ectopic beats which although uncomfortable & alarming at times, are actually harmless.  A beta blocker (propranolol) brought them back under control after the steroids seemed to trigger them off again and up till this most recent booster, everything had been ok. They gradually became worse and this time made me feel more unwell.... breathless on exertion and more  fatigue than usual.  Blood tests ruled out anaemia, diabetes and thyroid as possible causes and also heart failure. \nThey have significantly improved but I'm still seeing my cardiologist to rule out anything else.\nOn a more positive note...I'm now going into nursery class every week as a volunteer helper and it's bringing me such joy.\nMARCH 2023.\nJust had my 6monthly rheumatology appointment with Dr. Fiona Coath and all is good. My blood tests are ALL within normal parameters for the second time in a row and she's happy with my tapering regime. All the hard work ensuring I have a healthy diet and regular (appropriate) exercise seems to be paying off. \nI've missed approximately 4wks of helping out in nursery class again, as covid and flu are sweeping through the school. Hope to be back after Easter now.\nI'm currently on 3\u00bdmgs and about to start next \u00bdmg taper from 3\u00bdmgs to 3mgs. Fingers crossed."

My symptoms reduced dramatically two or three days after I began an initial dose of 15mg Prednisolone with gradual tapering. After a relapse in December 2018 my dose returned to 15mg. gradually  tapering until November 2019 when I developed double vision. This was corrected with a fresnel prism fitted to my glasses and again a return to 15mg. The double vision has improved and I'm currently taking 5mg Pred but regular clinic checks/consultations have been postponed due to the current pandemic.\n\nNow April 2021 and I'm on 2.5mg Pred  plus 10mg Leflunomide after being diagnosed with asymptomatic large vessel vasculitis ( aortitis). There was a blip at this time when I was seen by a rheumatology research fellow whose management plan stated I should move on from 2.5mg pred daily to 2.5mg on alternate days for one month then 2.5mg every third day. I wrote to the department expressing my concern at this plan and it was changed to a rather more acceptable plan of 2mg daily for one month then 2mg and 1mg (alternate days)/for a further month when the tapering plan became 2mg/1mg/1mg on a three day cycle. \n\nAt my review in April\u201922 with a locum rheumatologist his answer to my reporting tingling and numbness in toes was to diagnose \u201cwidespread osteoarthritis including osteoarthritis of hand, feet and knee\u201d. He said I \u201cmay feel better by proper shoes and shoe support  with a referral to a podiatrist for biochemical support\u201d if need be. All this was by looking at my hands and feet. He said my PMR had \u201cgone\u201d and I should stop taking Prednisolone. I was appalled but I didn\u2019t waste my breath in any discussion: however,  I couldn\u2019t leave without telling someone about this experience and followed that up with a letter to the specialist nurse and eventually another review with a competent rheumatologist who continued with pred tapering and disregarded \u2018\u2018widespread osteoarthritis \u201c. I continue to walk several times a week for an hour+ each time and garden, knit, sew, and occasional craft work with no pain in feet, knees or hands. \n\nHow time flies! It is now October 2023 and after a fairly uneventful 2+ years I am tapering very slowly to 0.5mg prednisolone daily. I have to admit that I\u2019m a little uneasy about taking the final step to zero and \u2018letting go\u2019 of my friend prednisolone.  \nThe aortitis was followed up with a second PET-CT in January this year which showed there had been no increase in any aortic dilation and a subsequent echocardiogram showed the aortic root was of normal size and the arch and ascending aorta appear to have normal dimensions.\nI was therefore considered to be \u2018stable\u2019. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 and continue with 10mg Leflunomide daily.\n\nMarch 2024. After 6 years on Prednisolone I have tapered to zero. I took my last 0.5mg at the end of January but will remain on 10mg Leflunomide daily for \u2018a while\u2019."

            "bio": "Hi There. Osteoarthritis in the 1980's which became really bad in both knees in the 90\u2019s when I really struggled with work, I was a teacher and, on my feet, pretty much all day and at times found it extremely hard just getting joints to work even to get out of bed. As I was relatively young, I had a real struggle to get the NHS to even think about joint replacement, they weren't really interested unless you were in your 70's. Physio and tablets is all that was on offer initially.  Full replacement in 1999, brilliant. Ill health retirement in 2001. OA in knees, feet, and hands but relatively under control. PMR in June 2020, which was a bit of a poo, pain so bad I ended up at the walk (in my case carry) in centre for the night. The doc there missed it, thought it was an OA flare which did not make sense to me, but was feeling too befuddled to query it. My own doctors picked it up the following week. I had no idea what PMR was at that point. Started on 15mg/day, quickly moved to 30mg/day for 5 days, then 25mg/day for 5 days, 20mg/day for two weeks. Did lots of research, found this incredible site. Now starting long tapers. Half way through the taper from 7mg to 6mg (June 2021) and at the moment all going well \u2013 plenty of time for that to change of course. \nUpdate 11/08/2021\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome deciding to be grumpy so chat with doc and Pred back up to 10mg, from 5mg, for three weeks, then usual (for me) 5 week (minimum) taper down again in hopes that it will bring it under control again without the need for surgery.\nUpdate 31/08/2022\nIn reality things are going well. Still using my modified DL .5mg five-week taper, longer if necessary. Had a query DVT in January, sent to hospital, had full check but nothing to worry about. I had an extremely painless right leg at the beginning of April 2022 where I had excruciating pain down my thigh, knee and shin. My shin felt like the shin bone was split down the middle with both halves rubbing against each other. Virtually unable to walk. PMR ruled out by myself and Doctor and referred onto an Orthopaedic specialist. Rested for about three weeks- no walks \u2013 No definitive result from the various doctors and pain etc eventually disappeared. Walking back to normal. Two funny instances with right leg this year and still, sometimes, it doesn\u2019t seem to do, straight away, what my brain tells it to. We will see if anything else transpires.\nWent back to 5mg from 3.5mg end of May/June for two months and now in second week of 4.5mg to 4.0mg\nI keep a spreadsheet diary of medication taken and in stock, makes ordering easy, and record BP daily and weight and Blood Sugar levels weekly. I also note anything that is relevant \u2013 covid tests etc. I send a copy of the diary to the doc whenever I order Pred or Omeprazole. Not actually seen a doctor since the hospital incident but they are always there for telephone consultations which are usually the same or following day. She/he organises blood tests and a DEXA scan when requested and supplies the prescription for the Pred I tell her I need. Not sure any of that is, in reality right, but she is happy to leave me to it and it does make my life easy. She always tells me to ring at any time if necessary.\nManaging to walk the bowwows again and generally manage to get around 5 - 6 or so miles done most mornings, either flat or a bit hilly depending on how I and they feel.\nNo formal medical education other than paediatric first aider, indoors and outdoors for many years.\nLiving in the North West of England, Rochdale/Wardle area of Greater Manchester.\n\nUpdate 01/2023\nMRI scan showed significant problems with my lower back, hence the problems mentioned earlier with leg and back pain.\n\nThe scan shows he has sciatica with neuropathic pain and if the pain persists, please refer to Salford Royal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                  MRI Spine Lumbar and Sacral:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nL5-S1: The disc is severely dehydrated significant bulge or protrusion. The left half of the disc appears more narrowed than the rest. This results in moderate-severe left existing foramen stenosis.\tThe exiting left L5 nerve root is impaired. Both facet joints show moderate-severe osteoarthritis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \nL4-L5: Severe bilateral facet joint arthritis is noted associated with subtle degenerative spondylolistheses. The right lateral recess is moderately narrowed due to hypertrophic facets and mild disc bulge. This could cause some irritation of the transiting right LS nerve root.\t  \nL3-L4: The facet joints show moderate-severe osteoarthritis associated with some degree of marrow oedema. The disc shows a mild annular bulge. No convincing nerve impingement is evident.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \nL 1-L2 and L2-L3 disc levels appear satisfactory for age.\t\t\t\t\t   \nNo acute bony injury or concerning marrow pathology.\t\t\t\t\t  \nThe scan shows he has sciatica with neuropathic pain and if the pain persists, please refer to Salford Royal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nUpdate 14/10/2024\n\nTapered slowly down and now been on zero Pred since the 1st September 2024 and so far all going well on the PMNR side. \n\nCTS is not so good and having significant problems with both wrists/fingers. Pain and lack of feeling in hands and fingertips makes completing certain day to day tasks difficult. Been on waiting list for surgery in both wrists since January 2024.\n\nThe back/leg problem only appears at times so fortunately I do not have to cope with it all the time.\n\nUpdate January 2025\nTook my last Pred in September 2024 and so far no problems regarding my PMR. still early days but it's looking hopeful that's it's gone for the time being. \nCTS is a different matter, still awaiting surgery and hands and wrists not in a good place regarding pain, which can go right up the arm, and the lack of feeling in fingers which can/does make doing things \"interesting\"."

            "bio": "I'm an 84-year-old gal who lives in Indiana, USA, with family in Indiana and Nova Scotia. I had lived alone in Maine for four years since 2016. In August 2019, I was diagnosed with GCA and left blind in my left eye. I was misdiagnosed initially, or that probably wouldn't have happened.\nIn 2020, I experienced a few flares that affected my right eye.  At that point, I had to decide and truly could not be by myself anymore.  At that time, I returned to Indiana and was sharing a home with my husband.  It has relieved me from all stress regarding driving to appointments to meet my most basic needs, like eating healthier and not being afraid of being alone and falling again.  He is happy to have the company. We have been married for 40+ years, and there have been a few separations.  He is 81, I am 84...we are a couple of OLD friends.  Here is to the future, whatever it may hold for however long~!!  I also have epilepsy and the steroids can water down seizure meds, seizure-free for 48 years.\nFebruary 16, 2023: I'm now down to 3.5 mg of prednisone and thrilled with that.  I'm beginning to think my adrenal glands are kicking in.  I have more energy, although I will have to work on strengthening it through the winter.  I've been pretty sedentary but I'm delighted to think my GCA may be quiet.   Shhhhhhh!     Onward and downward....slowly.\nI got down to 1 mg plus TCZ and then things flew apart.  I experienced a bowel perforation, escaped a colostomy, and then had quite a flare.  I'm presently taking 20 mg and hope to get back on my TCZ in a week.  My right eye is a bit blurry, but I'm hoping it is the excessive prednisone I was given when I had the flare: 500 mg IV for three days and then 60 mg tablets.  It is quite a ride.....but it will settle down, I'm sure when it is darn good and ready.\nWow, that bowel perforation was the fall of 2023...and until I reread my bio....I didn't recall how many times I flared and took 60mg.  The memory can be kind.\nJune 2024....I got to zero, not that -0- was a goal of mine, I just wanted quality of life.  After one month, at the end of July 2024, the headache started and got worse; though I could chew, the pain in the jaw joint was pretty intense, and I had shooting pains through my blind eye.  We went to the emergency room, and I received 500 mg IV of Prednisolone, but it was kept overnight.  The pain had lessened (A CLUE), but when the rheumy came in the AM, he sent me home with a script for 60mg per day, only to be taken if the pain came back. It was back with a vengeance in 36 hours.  I saw the rheumy two days later and he cut it to 5mg and wanted the neuro-ophthalmologist to see my eye on a dosage of less than 60mg so that nothing would be masked.  I saw him in two days and he immediately ordered 1250 mg IV infusions for the next three days.  I had lost some peripheral vision in my right eye.  After the infusions, I've been taking 60 mg a day...spacey.  I've seen both doctors since and am continuing on 60 mg per day.  Though the neuro has never, until the infusions, gotten involved in the dosage, he will now be determining that because he can see in, around, and behind my eye.  Now I have some nerve pain involvement, but it is tolerable. I just want to see what I can see, and I'll be happy.  \nJuly/August/September 2024   My tremors became more severe, I had balance issues..but I attributed everything to being on 60 mg per day.  Then I couldn't seem to walk correctly,  legs so stiff, numb, urinated beyond measure.....Finally, I felt strongly that this was something other than 60mg daily.  I'd been up and down the pred scale for five years.  My neuro-ophthalmologist told me to see a neurologist, and on 9/24/24, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.  Now, I'm searching for information and help, doing all that is in my power."

            "bio": "Conclusions up to the present. \nI think I am getting a handle on these two conditions and when it all started. These latter chronic symptoms have been present for nearly three years. Neck and shoulder stiffness, muscle contraction  numbness in feet, legs and joints and bad headaches mainly from the temples and across the top of the head. Up until recently I have managed them through a combination of aggressive cycling, general manual work on the farm, osteopath, sport massage and some pills. Conditions like broken bones, DVT, and PE in both lungs had to be medically treated. The earlier signs of cramping and badly contracted muscle and neck stiffness go back some ten years. The osteopath and masseuse were always perplexed at how tight my muscles seemed to be, so much so it slightly pulled my spine out of its proper alignment.\nIn September 2017 I had an horrific crash which left me with broken bones, some skin loss and a seriously broken body. Something like Chris Froomes\u2019 crash but with head injuries. It would have been nice to have the medical help Ineos provided him, but us ordinary mortals just have to struggle by ourselves. Nothing I could have done to prevent it. Brazing on the front forks dropout failed and the front wheel separated from the bike at 35mph downhill. Instant black out and no memory of the impact thank goodness. Lucky to be alive as I was  cycling with a good buddy who called for help. A lesson for all of you lone cyclists. You never know when something might happen. By the way the Kask helmet was flattened on the impact side. I wouldn\u2019t be writing this otherwise. Anything between your head and the ground is preferable to a smashed skull. A note to Chris. Boardman, helmets are essential. The head injury alone, long term concussion and damage to hearing, tinnitus, loss of balance and frightful headaches went on for the best part of a year. Any jarring motion made my brain hurt inside the skull, almost like it was swollen. It hurt to shout, sneeze or cough let alone shake it. My other physical injuries healed quickly as normal. Believe it or not I was back on the bike after 4 weeks but after a while the head pain and balance issues made me reconsider, opting for a few months recovery. I had two MRI head scans a year apart and they showed no bleeding or damage apart from age related deterioration. That was a relief. A recent scan has also come up clear apart from a small bleed which they indicate may have been a mild stroke undetected. I am due a full body MRI scan soon and hope that shows all clear. I suspect residual damage from the accident and want to check. Have had scan. All okay.\nIt took two years to get back to my level of cycling and fitness sufficient to ride for 6 continuous days from Pisa to Verona across the Dolomites in September 2019.  I averaged 13mph over 550 miles with 55,000ft of ascent. Now I can barely manage 10miles on the flat. What I think happened is that I focused on recovery and managed any side issues passing them off as the result of hard training and recovery. After the Dolomite ride I was seriously tired and in need of rest. I was down to 68kg and looking rather starved. I looked like death warmed up you could say, not a good picture.  It\u2019s quite possible that I overdid the effort and weakened my body\u2019s natural immunity. In March 2020 I stayed at a friends\u2019 villa in Almeria, SE Spain, on my own and cycled through the mountains. I caught the last flight back in this pandemic on 16th March. I suspect I may have contracted Covid but showed no symptoms. If so the virus could have kicked off all the background conditions I had been ignoring as cycling aches and pains. If not that virus maybe another. \nIs it possible these two conditions could have triggered the PE? Is it possible the serious hit to my head could have skewed the chemical balance in the brain and triggered the release of the PMR and GCA? This is speculation, but unless I can work out how it started I could be on these drugs for ever. Basically I seriously overdid the strain on my body and drained my last resource of resistance making me prone to anything waiting to pounce.\nI started to get serious symptoms which were passed to specialists to diagnose. Everything muscular and internal seemed to be going wrong and no clear explanation as to why. It built to the recent time when my body basically was closing down. Like I said earlier, I was reduced to a foetal position out of bright light in order to get any release from the symptoms. That\u2019s then to now and with the diagnosis I seem to be getting my body back. Nearly all the things going wrong are going right save for the residual symptoms which haven\u2019t been fully suppressed. The leg muscles are almost functioning properly. I\u2019m sure the strength is still there but they tire very quickly. Hopefully we\u2019ll get there soon. Calves quite good. Glutes hurt worst but get better with use. Hams next but again recover well. Quads are next worst but improve. Worst are hip flexors. They are not used to striding. They need extra work. All improve as the drugs effect works for longer each day. It seems that the perfect balance is when there is just enough drug to last a full day suppressing the conditions whilst being fully used up just before the next days\u2019 dose. Six weeks into treatment and I can confirm that nearly everything is working better.\t\n I\u2019ve decided to save my money on massage and correction as the effects  are largely a consequence of the contracted muscle caused by PMR. Until the Prednisolone takes full control of the condition 24/7 there is no point in the palliative effect of massage relieving the pain. It only masks the recovery of proper function of the muscle. This is quite a relief because it now explains why whatever correction and massage I used always reverted in a few months to the need for more. I need to fully understand how this disease works at the neuromuscular level and how it interferes with the proper firing of nerve synapses to relieve the contraction. When the Prednisolone finally suppresses the disease it won\u2019t be a cure. Without knowing the cause I will have to work to reduce the dose and work out an exercise regimen to regain my fitness. Only then can I determine to what level I can return.\n Despite everything I\u2019ve endured it has been a blessing in a perverse sort of way. I have known for years my body is not working as it should. Whatever I did I couldn\u2019t get a handle on what was wrong. I was hoping for a miracle drug that would put it all right. Now I know what\u2019s happened, the drug is no miracle, only something trying to stop my body going wrong. It\u2019s actually given me a real understanding and a massive challenge to try and get back to an even fitter and better physical condition. It\u2019s going to be an interesting period probably over a couple of years to regain even my old top level if that\u2019s possible. This diagnosis has given me something to aim for with hope. In trying to understand how I feel both physically and mentally I am more alive today than I have been in decades. \nMaybe it\u2019s the relief from pain, or the belief that this unpleasant and worrying phase is under control. I genuinely feel better than I have ever felt for more years than I can reckon. After six weeks on the drug it\u2019s almost fully suppressed the two conditions. My body is working better than it has in all areas, apart from stamina and being able to work all day not tiring. It may be a false euphoria caused by relief so I shouldn\u2019t expect too much, but it is good to feel that there is real hope of a full recovery. The sad irony is this same drug that has saved my body destroyed my fathers from his condition 40 years ago. How times change with knowledge and insight. Someone of religious bent might be giving thanks to God. I cannot claim such blind faith. It seems like a miracle, but it is all down to observation, knowledge, understanding and sheer dogged determination to not let it win. I have been given a second chance to enjoy my health and fulfil the next however many years productively. A new start with a body that is working properly. What a gift at 70.     \n \n So, that\u2019s it.         I have put this out there for consideration. \nI hope it may help someone who is in pain, depressed and confused not knowing why everything is going wrong and not being able to put a finger on the cause or the solution.   \n Hopefully you won\u2019t have this, but if you do I hope this helps. \n    \nOver and out.   Happy cycling.  Good luck."

            "bio": "I was diagnosed with PMR in May 2016, but in hindsight had symptoms that I couldn't make sense of for 6 months before that. The PMR 'relapsed' / flared over 3+ years, every time I reduced the prednisolone, however slow the taper. My CRP and ESR have always reflected periods of inflammation (See graphs in my posts). By November 2019 I felt the PMR might be in remission and I was symptom-free on 4mg, but the blood results were higher than ever. A PET-CT scan showed GCA-LVV, with aortitis and other large vessels involved. An increase in pred dealt with the inflammation, but my Rheumatologist predicted more relapses in future and I started on Tocilizumab in March 2020, just 10 days before the first Covid-19 'lockdown'! The TCZ seemed to tackle the inflammation, as I had more energy than at any  time in the previous 4 years. I was able to create a vegetable garden during 2020 & 2021, which would have been unheard of with PMR. During the pandemic I was given an extension of the NHS 52 week ration of TCZ, but this came to an end in March 2022. Even with TCZ I had a flare of the LVV and stayed on 5mg pred for almost 8 months in 2021, before starting to taper again. I reached 'Club Zero' for pred in April 2022!\nI was about to 'celebrate' a possible remission of the PMR & GCA-LVV, but my Rheumatologist feared the GCA-LVV could flare if I were to be on no medication, judging by the amount of inflammation seen on my PET-CT scan in November 2019, so I started Methotrexate in May 2022. She intended to keep me on MTX for a year or so - if it suited me, but I didn't feel as well on MTX as I did on TCZ, my CRP and ESR started to rise again and aches and pains returned. After 8 months on MTX, in January 2023 I went back on 5mg pred and the MTX was discontinued. Throughout 2023 and 2024 I tapered down very gradually, and up again, but get stuck around 3mg, so that's where I'll stay at the start of 2025 - in my 9th year since diagnosis.\nMy other hobby, apart from gardening,  is rag rug-making, hence my alias \"Rugger\"!  My avatar is a circular braided rug about 3 feet in diameter. Contrary to what some people have thought, I'm female and not a rugby player or fan! I live in West Yorkshire, UK and am retired from working in the NHS.\nIn 2017 I helped set up the Yorkshire support group of PMRGCAuk and continue as one of the present Group Organisers."

I had thought that I was suffering either from fibromyalgia or ME. When she diagnosed me, I had never heard of either condition despite extensive Googling. I'll never forget the relief of losing the terrible pain and stiffness within a couple of hours of my first dose of Pred. Of course there are plenty of other difficulties that don't go - above all the fatigue - and Pred brings its own side effects, but on balance I believe that being close to painfree and relatively mobile is worth everything else."

I slightly pulled a muscle in my back on 1 January 2020 and when it got worse after 6 weeks, I went back to the physio, who kept hinting that I was suffering from stress, which was news to me. After another 6 weeks of increasingly agonising exercises,  I finally went to GP and had diagnosis of PMR - 15mg of pre, increase after a few days to 20mg, then to 25mg.\nI managed to go back to work that Summer (Lockdown had been a boon in the meantime). \nBy Christmas I was getting ridiculously tired and GP sent me to A&E with a growing headache in March. GCA/LVV variously diagnosed, 60 mg pred. Since then, I had Methotrexate for some months and said Goodbye to most of my hair. Could never get below 15mg Pred, so started on TCZ Dec 2021. Since Feb 2022 reducing very quickly o consultant's orders."

Have been tapering slowly without GP help from the beginning; this forum, particularly the \"aunties\" have been more than helpful. CRP and ESR have been normal after the initial diagnosis. \nThe only side effects from the prednisolone/PMR have been fatigue, lack of energy and strength.. I still manage a game each week of racquet ball, walk my dog daily, and go bell ringing twice or three times a week.\nI was also diagnosed with prostate cancer in July 2016, which hasn't helped. Mostly, it is the hot sweats caused by the hormone treatment injections. These finished in August 2019, but the sweats are still continuing!\nI first got to 5mg in April 2017,so it's been over three more years to get down to my current level, though I was at zero for 10 days at the beginning of October 2020, before going up again a bit.\nAt the beginning of May 2021, I have reduced to zero! Whether this will work out ok this time remains to be seen. It didn\u2019t!\nAfter a further failed attempt at zero, I finally took my last (hopefully) pred on 30th Sept 2022, making it a total of seven years and nine months on this treatment.\nNow, as I write on 2nd May 2023, it is seven months on zero, so, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m in remission.\nAs of today - 4th October 2023- I\u2019ve been off prednisolone for one year and four days.

It's been a roller coaster ride but with Prednisone, it's been at least tolerable. \n\nI've had huge muscle spasms from my hip girdle right up to my ribs and now pulling on my stomach muscles. I can barely move and now barely eat because my stomach is so tight. Like a boa constrictor wrapped around your torso.\n\n\nOn just touching my back, I can feel the pain. It's hard to breathe because when I take a deeper breath, it pulls right from my hips right up through my torso.\n\nI have lost 20 lbs. over the 4 months I've been only able to eat about half portions. Under other circumstances...\n\nSince I was unable to tolerate Alendronic Acid tablets, opted for the Zolendronic Infusion last week. Done in the chemotherapy department of one of the hospitals here in Halifax, NS. Took about 15 minutes and then a half hour afterward to check vitals, etc. There can be side effects. Not going there. Fingers crossed it helps with the bones.\n\nUnable to take physio at this time because my spine is quite brittle and they don't want to risk more vertebral fractures (now at 6 plus two vertebroplasties). Exercise is walking with walker. I'm on the second floor, so getting outdoors is a real challenge as it takes two of us. Married to my heating pad. Currently awaiting MRI to determine which vertebrae are in need of vertebroplasties next.\n\nI am an abuse survivor (lifetime), which has actually enabled me to cope with what I'm going through currently. \n\nDon't let anyone tell you \"there are those worse off\". There indeed are, but this is your personal experience. Present moment living helps. Worrying changes nothing.\n\nUpdate Sept 18/24: \nCurrently living with 10 vertebral compression fractures. The majority have happened since July 2023. Had 2 vertebroplasties done Sept. 2023. Osteo Specialist says no more. I've had one Zoledronic Acid infusion in October 2023 and scheduled for the next one this November 2024. Miraculously, got in early to our Pain Management Clinic in Halifax after a 2 year wait. Could have been 5, but I was on a cancellation list. The doctor, after squeezing up and down my spine and neck and hitting many trigger points; also hips and sides of thighs, has concluded I also have \"fibromyalgia\", or the newer version thereof. Essentially all my nerves are on high alert and inflammed. He would give me nothing more for pain. No shots as pain is too widedpread and is referring me back to GP who sent me there in the first place, to have my pain addressed. So my list goes on. Very unsure about his diagnosis. He would not refer me to a Neurologist. Said the ball is back in GPs court. Here am I, the monkey in the middle...so that said...\nPMR, Osteoporosis, Fibro, Diverticular Disease, Cartaracts (surgeries done), Hypertesion, Cholesterol high, Generalized Anxiety, Gall Bladder shot.  At least I still am able to live alone and do all the things which that involves and grateful for it."

Sudden onset of symptoms in March 2018 following upon (with hindsight) a perfect storm of stressful events. Given naproxen at first which did not touch the pain. While waiting to see GP I saw a chiropractor who began taking a history then stopped, told me he thought I had PMR and to go to see my GP. Tests pointed to PMR. Started on 20mg pred on the Tuesday. By the Saturday I was pain free. Made the schoolgirl error of thinking I was cured so went up a few mountains that weekend! Initially I couldn't see my \"own\" GP. Was started on a quick reduction plan which caused a couple of flares. Saw my usual GP, sharp intake of breath.....\"rather faster than I would have recommended\u201d, \u201cGPs' biggest mistake is to try and get patients off steroids too quickly\". I've stuck with him since and adopted a much slower tapering approach and am now on 5mg (January 2020 - update still on 5mg January 2021...). GP had not heard of PMRGCA UK or this site but I printed off Dorset Lady's excel spread sheet to show him what I planned for future tapers. He was happy with that approach although he had not seen it before. I have obtained much more information and help on this site than anywhere else and am extremely glad I found it! Update: May 2021 4.5mg. July 2022 4mg trying to reduce to 3.5mg."

            "bio": "Hello everyone,\n\n    I\u2019m in Northern California.   Moved here after living in Atlanta for 45 years.  Female, age 80.  \n    In December 2017 I started having severe shoulder, neck pain and head pain in the occipital area at the back of my head. Nothing helped the pain.  A rheumatologist first  diagnosed me with PMR, then GCa in 2018 and put me on 40 mg of prednisone.  I didn\u2019t have vision symptoms. \n   In three months he fired me from his practice because I didn\u2019t taper fast enough.   I was on my third rheumy and had finally found one who listens and was happy for me to do a slow taper, DSNS plan.  I had gotten down to 8.5 mg when she left the practice in 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic.  I tried another rheumy but she didn\u2019t known much about PMR/GCA.   After that I treated flares myself by increasing pred and then coming back down. \n      Because  of the pandemic, fires in Northern California, some flares, and constant family and financial turmoil, I basically stopped tapering and got my prednisone  from my GP.  She is so overwhelmed and unfamiliar with PMR/GCA that she or her assistant didn\u2019t ever discuss my refills until January of this year, 2024.  She has Moab notified me she will not refill the prednisone any more and has referred me to another medical system\u2019s rheumatology practice.  \n     I had cataract surgery for both eyes in 2022.  The process took almost a year to complete due to doctors leaving and appointments being cancelled.\n      I live with my son who helps me, but  who has health, (Crohns disease),  and emotional issues of his own.  \n       Five 1/2 years after diagnosis I\u2019ve never been able to get below 8 1/2 mg. and pred is starting to show its effects. I\u2019ve recently been having walking problems and shoulder pain.  Ive been seen by and orthopedist who diagnosed me with torn tendons in the left hip and both shoulders.  No surgery possible for the hip as an MRI showed there is muscle atrophy in the joint and nothing for the tendon to attach to.  The right knee is arthritic and not strong.  I must use a cane all the time and I\u2019m afraid of falling. \n        In finally updating this bio,  I\u2019m shocked to realize I\u2019ve been on pred for so long.  I had been thinking it was only three years.   Seems I haven't plowed through the turmoil, stress, and unexpected problems of life well  enough to taper successfully. I\u2019ve always suffered from anxiety and depression and fear of doctors, I have a therapist, but no strong support from anyone else. \n    More pain and problems in other places, getting to be a long list, discouraging."

In 2020 I was diagnosed with large vessel vasculitis and, with the help of tocilizumab, managed to taper to 2mgs.  Have been battling ever since.\nIt is now June 2023 and I have managed to taper off prednisolone and have been pred free for 20 weeks now.  I am continuing with TCZ, and am attempting to taper my injections from 3 weekly to 3.5 weekly, and then to 4 weekly.  I am experiencing muscle and some joint stiffness but no pain.  Just waiting to see if I am OK, before extending the TCZ gap to 4 weeks. \nNov 2023 update ... I have been off pred for 40 weeks and have tapered the TCZ jabs to 4 weekly. I feel fragile and headachy in the 4th week before the jab, but otherwise doing well.\nJune 2024 update ... 69 weeks off pred and 12th round of 4 weekly tcz jabs and now the proverbial has hit the fan! Feeling well, I had a routine check up with my Rheumatologist, who is a new and young woman taking over some of my retiring Rheumy's patients. Bloods revealed hugely elevated inflammatory markers. But why, with no pain? A round of tests, PET-CT, CT-Angiogram, Dexa (just to \nbe sure) and numerous bloods suggested nothing sinister but a relapse of the LVV. So, 25mgs pred, weekly tcz, Bactrim x 3 weekly until I'm below 20mgs and a bone protector called Resprim Forte(sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim) as I'm now oesteosporitic \ud83d\ude2b. Doc is on the ball and despite the shock, I feel in good hands. I begin the taper after 2 weeks on 25mgs pred with weekly blood monitoring \ud83e\udd1e\n21/10/24 I have tapered to 5mgs pred but my neutrophils are soooo low we have decided to stall the TCZ for the time being.  Even after stretching to fortnightly jabs, the neutrophils have remained very low.  I\u2019ll have a blood test in a couple of weeks to see what\u2019s happening with inflammation.\n10/2/25\nSo the inflammation came racing back once TCZ was stopped.  After increasing pred to 15mgs, it\u2019s taken a few weeks to get down to 10mgs pred, and inflammation is still not stable.  Rheumy has suggested I join her public clinic at Royal Perth Hospital in order to access either secukinumab or upadacitinib.  In the meantime, I am remaining on 10mgs until I see her at the end of March.  By then we\u2019ll know if I have been given approval to join the clinic."

            "bio": "Diagnosed by GP as possible PMR Nov 2022.  Classic pattern of hip, buttocks, thighs stiffness and pain, sides of knees and extreme debilitating fatigue, plus muscles became very tired after little effort.  Inflammatory markers not raised.  RA, lupus and fibromyalgia excluded.  Then Jan 2023, caught flu and triggered shoulder, neck and upper arm pain, unable to turn my head so started pred 15 mg Feb 2023 with miraculous results, completely free from pain and stiffness within hours.  After 15mg for 2 weeks, reduction to 10mg due to psych effects and then again after a week to 7.5 mg. In May reduced to 5mg as still suffering side effects.  Pain and stiffness did not start to return until 5 mg, but still 80-90% effective.  Extreme fatigue returned after dropping to 5 mg.  Vit D at 4,000 IU helped fatigue noticeably.\n\nI blame my PMR on years of work stress and personal trauma.  Became so ill May 2021, forced to stop work and take early retirement.  Now starting to suspect that viral infections trigger a flare in PMR symptoms and also possible strong dietary correlation.  Also learned, Do whatever makes you happy (if I had enough energy).\n\nWas always athletic and fit, ran, walked, cycled, swam, I had walked to 18,000 ft in the Himalaya when all this started.  Classic atopic family with asthma, eczema and hayfever allergies.  Have always had problems with my muscles, which I put down to sporting injuries and pattern of physio, osteopathic treatments. \n\nHard to say when my symptoms first started, possibly as long ago as 2003.  I can\u2019t pinpoint first flare, but stiffness and tiredness started in my early 40s, physio advised seeing a rheumatologist, but GP did not take very seriously.  Prescribed diclofenac, as effective as pred is now, but effectiveness only lasted a few weeks, so did not persist.  Since then, every few months, I have had a flare of same symptoms, stiffness, pain, fatigue, which lasts a few months and then disappears, although stiffness persisted.  I have an idea that the flares correlate to viral infections, but too long ago to be sure, or possibly stress.  Many visits to GP, but nothing done until GP in Nov 22.\n\nFirst really bad attack happened around 2007, could hardly walk due to stiffness and pain, coinciding with flare of eczema on my arms and severe GI symptoms.  GI symptoms investigated and nothing found so labelled IBS.  I suspected diet and tried FODMAPs diet, which helped GI symptoms.  Then eliminated wheat and the pain, stiffness, brain fog, palpitations, fatigue vanished within 48 hrs.  Have been gluten free since.  Though continued to get flares of PMR type symptoms; hip girdle and rotator cuff type pain.  Stopped work May 2021, at the time, I thought due to stress and mental health, but now know that there is an underlying physical reason.  Summer 22 was hell for me, for months could not get up stairs, classic PMR Donald Duck waddle, toddler stomp down the stairs and old person groaning noises to get me out of a chair.  Saw GP in Nov 22 as wondered why I was not recovering from what I thought was a stress burnout and that is when I got a tentative diagnosis.  New GP and first one to take it all seriously.  The flare was tapering off at the end of the year without treatment by the time I saw the GP, but I got flu in Jan 2023 and all the symptoms kicked off again.  The worst it has ever been.  This time, my neck, trapezoid and shoulders, upper arms affected aswell as the hip girdle, lower back and legs etc.  I was a complete mess and could hardly move, so finally gave in and went on the pred.  \n\nI can\u2019t say that the pred is wonderful for me, or that my quality of life is better.  The control of pain and stiffness is slightly better than taking ibuprofen, but I hate the way that pred makes me feel.  If I could stop the pred tomorrow, I would, in a heart beat.\n\nDiet seems to be majorly important for me.  I was prediabetic last year and when I was on the prediabetes diet, my symptoms were significantly better during that time.  When I went on pred, I went back to eating foods with low Glycaemic Index and my weight has been stable.  When I lapse, I have discovered that I am extremely sensitive to added sugar, alcohol less so, very reactive to fried high carb snacks like crisps and tortilla crisps with loads of additives.  I really suffer the next day and a day or so after lapsing.\n\nFor now, I am continuing with the pred and trying to taper, and at the same time continue to explore the diet.  I am certain that I have PMR, but I also suspect that my dietary intolerance might have worsened, exacerbating the PMR symptoms.  Lastly, many PMR sufferers are anaemic, so I plan to try some iron to see if that helps the debilitating tiredness.\n\nIn case you wonder about the screen nick, I tried about 20 names when I joined and each one I tried was already taken. I finally tried gimmestrength in frustration, which was also taken \ud83d\ude03, so this is what I ended up with.  It would seem that finding an acceptable user name to join the site is more difficult than finding a cure for PMR.\n\nUpdated 05 July 2023.\n\nBlood results from 5 Sept 2023:\nCRP less than 5 mg/l\nERS 14 mm/h\nRheumatoid factor less than 10 iu/ml\nAnti-nuclear factor negative (less than 1/100)\nIron, B12, folate and Vit D levels OK.\nT4 and TSH normal\nHb a1c 39 mmol/mol - so 9 months pred hasn't put me back in the pre-diabetes zone yet. \nWeight fairly stable but put on 2 or 3 lbs.\nFBC all within acceptable range.\nNeutrophils 7.84 (normal range 1.5-7.2) - slightly raised due to pred?\n\nSo on the face of it, I look pretty healthy.  So why do I feel so crap then?  I made a list of my symptoms and they covered 2 sides of A4.  Saw the nice lady GP today and she still thinks that my symptoms sound like PMR, but there is still some random stuff going on (dryness, worsening asthma and thyroid) that doesn't fully fit.  She is going to speak to rheumatology about possibility of Sjogrens and is also sending me for a neck scan to look at my thyroid.  Thyroid function was normal, but I have an enlarged painful thyroid gland, it seems.\n\nUpdated 27 Sept 2023."

Starting on 15mg prednisolone, lansoprazole, vitamin d and calcium on 25.06.21.\n\n Reduced to 12.5mg on 16.07.21. Reduced to 10mg on 06.08.21. Trying 9mg from 03.09.21. 01.10.21 struggling with 8mg but too painful so 14.10.21 back up to 9mg. 20.10.21 GP agreed to increase to 10mg for 2 months. \n\n24.12.21 9.5mg. 30.12.21 9mg. 21.01.22 8.5mg. 11.02.22 8mg. Waiting for results of recent MRI. 04.03.22 7.5mg. 25.03.22 7mg. \n\nMRI results showed 2 torn tendons in right shoulder and mild tendonitis in both shoulders. Tendonitis in left gluteus minimus and medius. Seeing NHS physio.\n\n22.04.22 6.5mg, 13.05.22 6mg, 04.06.22 5.5mg. Feel worse after vaccine jab 4 Moderna on 08.06.22? 5mg 25.06.22. 4.5mg on 22.07.22. Possibly signs of muscle recovery starting?\n\n15.08.22 4mg. 09.09.22 3.5mg. 07.10.22 3mg and think I should stop reducing for a while?\n\n31.10.22 Pfizer Bivalent vaccine. 04.11.22 2.5mg. 02.12.22 2mg.  Think pain worse but freezing cold and wet windy weather may also be unhelpful.\n\nManaged Christmas 2022 far better than 2021. Kept going longer, sat on floor with kids, went to park on Boxing Day.\n\n28.12.22 met Consultant Rheumatologist. Told that I don't have PMR or any rheumatological disorder. Based on ability to move and blood test results in January and June 2022. Instructed to reduce pred by 0.5mg every 3 weeks. \n\nWants to refer me to MSK Physio again. Possibly spinal specialist. X-ray of thoracic spine - looking at my scoliosis - no results yet.\n\n29.12.22 blood tests. CRP 3 (range 0-5). ESR 13 (range 0-15). \n\nStarted reduction towards 1.5mg 30.12.23. 1mg from 20.01.23.  Xray report 31.01.23 confirms scoliosis and states bones osteopenic in appearance. \n\nApprox 0.75mg from 09.02.23. 0.5mg from 17.02.23. 0.25mg from 24.02.23. Zero 03.03.23."

As yet no grandchildren but ever hopeful. \nIt\u2019s over six years  years since I learned about this strange condition which affects every aspect of my life and I don\u2019t feel as if I am getting any closer to the end of this journey.  I was pretty much stuck at 8mg of prednisolone for four years and finally saw a Rheumatologist who prescribed leflunomide but after waiting to have my flu jab and Covid booster before starting it, posts on this forum made me reluctant to start it. \nSince diagnosis of PMR I have had a lot of pain in my jaw and feared some extra cranial GCA issues but in 2023 a referral to Maxillofacial finally indicated mechanical problems in the joint. So I persevered in tapering my prednisolone and was quite proud of myself for getting down to 5mg. \nIt wasn\u2019t long before my body demanded more of the wonder drug that makes my life good and struggled with the nausea, fatigue and general flakiness of adrenal insufficiency. And the old aches and pains of osteoarthritis in my thumbs, hands, and wrist started making daily life very uncomfortable.  Acid reflux had caused a constant sore throat and I was referred for an MRI and gastroscopy which confirmed non cancerous polyps throughout my digestive system. \nThe MRI showed an enlargement of my pituitary gland and I have had multiple blood tests and eye examinations and waiting to see the Neurosurgeons in August 2024. I am now under Endocrinology as well and waiting for a short synacthen test in August.\nEarly in 2024 I developed what I thought was sciatica. This has continued to get worse despite exercise and has settled in my right hip and calf. X ray shows cam impingement but I have been referred for phsiotherapy as a start point.\nIn July 2024 The GP ran some blood tests and these indicate anaemia which might result from a blood protein disorder called MGUS, another thing I had never heard of.  I will know more when the results are released next month. It\u2019s been a tough year."

Been here since May, so still early doors.  No major flares since diagnosis, unlike many on the forum sadly, so feel very lucky. Had 'blips' when I've needed to increase slightly  and taper back down, but finally got here to zero pred. Taking things slowly, and nothing for granted. Still pacing myself whilst trying to increase strength and stamina with walking a little more,  but no cycling or swimming or fitness classes yet. Have two beautiful grandchildren now."

            "bio": "I was diagnosed some years ago with high cholesterol and then high blood pressure, I improved my diet including starting to use Benecol spread, but didn\u2019t take any medication for the high blood pressure.\nAbout three years ago I felt very unwell one evening, symptoms were numb hands and arms, numb mouth and problems with my vision.\nI went to A and E where they found that my blood pressure was dangerously high, was kept in for that night and the next day when they carried out lots of tests. I was given Ramipril and Amlodipine to bring the blood pressure down and stayed on these, having bouts of excruciating migraines until approx. 5 months ago when my feet and right leg swelled up. When I saw a GP it was suggested that when I went to A and E I may have had a mini stroke.\n\nMarch 2020  I was very concerned as I couldn\u2019t walk properly or get any shoes on. Soon after, the aches and pains began! Plus all the usual, not being able to turn over in bed etc. etc. I was prescribed various medications to address the problems but didn\u2019t take them as I felt that the Ramipril and Amlodipine may have been responsible for the aches and pains as well as the swollen legs and foot.\nEven though I realised that you should not stop taking blood pressure medication without discussing it with your GP I did stop, and bought a blood pressure monitor. My blood pressure had stayed at a reasonable level until about three weeks ago when I realised that there was something very wrong with me and I stopped monitoring it because I was just concentrating on trying to find out what is wrong with me (I know that I need to start again)\nNow I also have burst blood vessels in a finger on one hand and also swellings on the palm of my hand, and also a claw like other hand with  pain going up the arm and swellings on the palm.\n\n\n\nDiagnosed with Rheumatoid Disease and PMR 2020 which are not under control . Some uncertainty about definite diagnosis.\n\nTold by Optician that I have blepharitis approx. 2021.\n\nDiagnosed with Scoliosis and Spinal Stenosis /Compressed Cauda Equina/Fractured Vertebrae 2022, had consultation with neurosurgeon in December 2022, operation on my spine recommended. \nStill waiting for letter and information about the operation following the consultation. Still waiting for result of DEXA scan. March 2023.\nDiagnosed with Osteoporosis. \n\nTaking 5mg Amlodipine for high blood pressure, 7mg Prednisolone for PMR, and 7  1/2 mg Methotrexate Metoject for inflammatory arthritis .\n\nDiagnosed with Benign Essential Tremor.\n\nDiagnosed with low functioning kidneys (Stage 3a CKD) in December 2022, no information, dietary advice or referral to a nephrologist. \n\nDiagnosed with anxiety and depression January 2023, awaiting CBT. \n\nMethotrexate paused due to a viral infection, February.\n\nDiagnosed with high cholesterol February GP recommended statins, no dietary advice.  Decided to decline for now.\n\nHave requested my GP to refer me for physio (for back and feet) currently being assessed March.\n\nPhysio is going to refer me to a podiatrist. \n\nStopped Amlodipine, hoping problems with feet/legs may improve a little. Started Losartan 50 mg a day instead. March.\n\nIncreased Prednisolone to 7 1/2 mg a day. Increased to 9mg a day March.\n\nMigraines, Amitriptyline 10mg 1 or 2 at night. \n\n24 March Heart attack.\n\n27 March Angioplasty.\n\nStopped Losartan.\n\nNeurological symptoms, trouble spelling words. \n\nNew medication regime, many new medications. Lansoprazole 30mg 1 a day, Bisoprolol 2.5mg 1 a day, Dispersible Asprin 75mg 1 a day, Ticagrelor 90mg 1 twice a day, Ramipril 2.5mg 1 a day, Atorvastatin 80mg 1 a day, Nitrolingual pump spray when needed. \n\nApril Cardiac Rehabilitation (Other health conditions preventing me from having Rehabilitation).\n\nMay First Homehelp visit. \n\nMay Post MI Clinic\n\nMay Physio Review/Starting exercises for spinal stenosis. \n\nEnd of May First session of CBT.\n\nBeginning of May Increasing Oedema, feet particularly badly affected. Finding it difficult to walk.\n\nJune 5 6 monthly Rheumatology appointment.  \n\nJune 5  Admitted to hospital with dangerously high blood pressure. In A and E for 17 hours, No sleep, very little food etc. plus heated \u2018discussions\u2019 with doctors and nurses re my medication not helping to lower blood pressure, in fact the opposite!\n\nJune 13  Medication review with GP pharmacist.\n\nJune  Assessed and approved for eligibility for pre filled Dosset Box. Hopefully beginning July 7. \n\nJuly  New medication regime.  \n20mg Pantoprazole 1 a day, 10mg Prednisolone a day, 75mg Dispersible Aspirin 1 a day, 7.5mg Ramipril a day,  2.5mg Bisoprolol  1 a day,  90mg  Ticagrelor 1 twice a day, 80mg Atorvastatin 1 a day, Nitrolingual pump spray when needed, 7.5mg sub cut Methotrexate a week, \n\nJuly 4  Follow up Rheumatology appointment. Hope to find out about the possibility of being prescribed a biologic. \nMy Rheumatologist has decided that I should start taking 7.5mg sub cut Methotrexate again alongside tapering Prednisolone. He also wants me to take Alendronic Acid (something I have tried to avoid) as I have osteoporosis. Will have another appointment with him in December.\n\nSeptember Podiatry appointment for assessment.\n\nSeptember 21 Pain Management appointment, referred for MRI.\n\nOctober 4 MRI scan.\n\nOctober 16 Telephone consultation with Neurosurgeon re possible laminectomy to help with spinal stenosis pain.\n\nOctober 19 Appointment with Pain Management consultant to discuss results of MRI.  Scan shows 2 \u2018slipped discs\u2019, Options would have been a laminectomy or a steroid injection but heart meds prevent either of these, so discharged back to rheumatologist\u2019s care. If I am able to stop taking the blood thinner in March 2024 the operation may be a possibility. Disappointed as I feel that I am back to square one. \n\nOctober 25  A and E with high blood pressure, breathlessness and dull ache in chest. Diagnosed with Angina. \n\nNovember 16  Appointment for Cardiac Dobutamine Stress Echo test. Cancelled due to staff training day. No notification!\n\nNovember 21 Resumed taking Methotrexate after 4 week break. \n\nNovember 29 Podiatry appointment. Have cancelled and rebooked.\n\nDecember 7 Rescheduled Cardiac Dobutamine Stress Echo test. Have cancelled, awaiting new appointment.\n\nDecember 9 Increased Prednisolone from 10mg a day to 11mg a day. Finding pain difficult to deal with. \n\nDecember 12 Appointment with Rheumatology Consultant. Have been told to stop taking Methotrexate for good as yesterdays blood test showed abnormalities again. The Consultant has now prescribed Gabapentine for pain relief and is considering prescribing Leflunomide in a few months time depending on the results of ongoing fortnightly blood tests. He now thinks a lot of my pain is due to Osteoarthritis."

I lost heart over last winter,  my body became a riot of sun damage, SCCs, BCCs which all meant 'procedures' with stitches galore and Efudix, which I have used without problems on actinic keratoses.  One specialist prescribed this for a stubborn non-healing lesion on my eyelid - result was  an allergic reaction and several weeks of excruciating rawness and pain until I saw another consultant who stopped it immediately and prescribed Hydrocortisone.   Utter relief.      My biggest regret is not being able to swim in the river/sea due to healing wounds.  At least I can walk daily to gaze longingly at the waves.   And a little companion in the shape of a robin who flies to my hand to feed - well, he gets organic cheese and just can't say no. I've had 2 generations of robins, and blackbirds keeping me company.  Think it saved my sanity.\n\nMy GP finally referred me to a Rheumatologist last January - disasterous meeting.  His first words were 'I see no signs of PMR,  no inflammation indicators. Can you do this? (rising from chair; raising hands above head; etc.)  ' Yes, and surely the steroids are just doing their job at managing inflammation ...??' It got worse, he wasn't the consultant but a registrar with an agenda. ' We want you on Leflunomide, here's a leaflet, oh sorry we've run out, will send you one and make an appointment in another 6 months'.   'I'm reluctant to sign up to a drug I have very little information on and if I haven't got PMR can you suggest any other possibilities. RA?  '  but he ignored my obvious wish for a discussion and went off to see the Consultant for 10 minutes.  Icy politeness was all I could manage by then.    Still waiting for leaflet and appointment.  \n\nTwo strokes 2020, 2021, TIA March this year - wonderful Hospital doctor who linked these to possibly being migraine induced as MRI scans have never shown damage.  I haven't had migraines until the last couple of years, but they certainly became a very upsetting, if extremely colourful,  experience - optician called them the Prisoners Cinema type where the visions continue for around 20 minutes even with closed eyes.  Five consecutive  \n evenings of these last year at a time of stress, resulting in confusion and inability to use computer.  More research into this, ongoing.    I can only hope for a less, shall we say, 'eventful' and discombobulating winter ahead."

I was sitting in my best friend\u2019s office, who happens to be a Psychiatrist.  She asked me how my headache was and I told her it was a BEAST and that I could not get rid of it.  I then pulled back my hair and said \u201cAnd, what is this?\u201d showing her the beaded vein by my temple.  Her eyes bugged out like a cartoon characters, she took a piece of paper, wrote on it, passed it to me and said \u201cGo call your GP now and tell them that Dr. (her name) would like you to get Joy in today for possible G.C.A\u201d.  I secured an afternoon appointment, my GP apologized for missing the diagnosis when I was there 2 weeks prior for the headache (and showed her the vein).  She explained that she had never seen G.C.A.  Although she did not feel qualified to treat it, she started me on 40 mg of Prednisone, and secured an appointment the next day with a Rheumatologist.  That was on a Monday and by that Thursday I had the biopsy, which was positive.  (Diagnosed with PMR February, 2018.)

Hardening of the arteries seen on head MRI . \nPain I can cope with to a degree , but have developed hip pain and irrational anxiety when on anything any lower than 7.5mg , which in turn creates more anxiety. Any stress results in nausea and feeling ill like flu . Pred , both a life saver and a demon."

Anyway, in the last year, my symptoms have become worse but, because of COVID, Ive not been able to have a lung function test since I was first diagnosed.  But, Ive just had a telephone consultation over the phone with a respiratory nurse and she now informs me that my COPD is MODERATE.

I had the classic symptoms of pain in my shoulders and then my hips which developed quickly in just over three weeks until I could barely dress myself.  I had chest and hip X-rays which were normal and blood tests which revealed an ESR of 44.  My Gp immediately put me on a dose of 15mg of Prednisolone.  After about 4 days I felt much better but had difficulty sleeping as I was told to take the Pred at night.   I changed this to a breakfast dose and my sleep improved.   My first Pred reduction was after 3 weeks to 12.5 mg.  Looking back I definitely had a flare on this dose but was told to persevere by the Rheumatology consultant.   After another three weeks I was told to reduce to 10mg.  Again another flare and back up to 12.5.  This has been the way my Pred journey has been.  I quickly realized from the posts on health unlocked that slow and steady is the way to go.  I struggled badly to get below 10mg of Pred but using the DSNS method I made it to 8.5 mg.  My Rheumatologist is insisting I reduce now by .5 mg per month.  I\u2019ve tried twice to get down to 8 but the pain returns.  I am currently on 8mg but experiencing the worst pain since diagnosed in August 2020.  The consultant now wants me to take Methotrexate.  I am really against taking this drug yet.  I have type 2 diabetes and I\u2019m currently on 9 prescription medications including Risedronate which the consultant insists I take and won\u2019t refer me for a Dexascan.  I\u2019m currently in a bad place with this illness and will write a post to hopefully get some advice.  I have read posts every day since Joining the forum in October 2020 and this site has been invaluable to me."

After that fed with castor oil, ex-lax chocolate, syrup of figs, senokot - anything mother could think of.  I have always suffered from constipation which GP eventually put down to IBS-C.

Anyway, in January 2017 I had an angiogram (followed by a stroke 4 days late but 98% recovered) and there was a blockage in my LAD and it was decided that due to the position of this blockage I would need a bypass.\nIn June 2017 I had a single bypass using my mammary artery and was discharged after only 4 days.\nRecovery went very well and all was fine until September last year (2021) when I started having some 'twinges', in October they became worse and I realised I had angina pain again and after a phone conversation with my GP was told to go straight to A & E which I did.\nI appreciate that A & E doctors cannot be experts in everything but from 2 pm Monday until about 9 am Tuesday I kept being told that I had acid reflux (deja vu). I stuck to my guns and was eventually admitted to a ward later that Tuesday.\nI was seen by a cardiologist on the Wednesday who told me I would be transferred to another hospital for an angiogram which I was on the 22nd October (Friday)\nThe angiogram revealed a blockage of the RCA which to their surprise was badly calcified so I had to have the artery drilled out to fit 2 stents.\nI was kept in overnight and discharged on the Saturday.\n3 full months later I am feeling good but very aware that things can change.\nMy motto is listen to your body as you know it better than anyone else and stick to your guns if you know something to be true even if the doctors tell you it isn't."

Current (2023) meds: Eplerenone, Lansoprazole, Aspirin, Candesartin, Isosorbide, Carvedilol, Rosuvastatin, Empagliflozin, Vitamin D. Also Furosemide as & when.\n\nSince the heart attack in 2018 I have piled on the weight, despite going to the gym and regular cycling (2022 did London-Brighton) and other exercise, and am now Type II Diabetic, with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in my feet and lower legs. GP not interested. The Empagliflozin is both a heart and diabetes drug, so not on any other drugs.\n\nSuddenly went deaf in right ear Nov/Dec 2020. Had MRI Feb 2022, and diagnosed with small/medium sized Acoustic Neuroma. This had grown from 1cm to 1.5cm (mainly a cyst that was growing on the tumour) in the 6 months to Sept 2022, so was offered translab surgery which I turned down (partly because I couldn't afford the recovery time), so was offered Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (FSRT) instead. 5 weeks of short daily blasts Mon-Fri. Completed Feb 2023. Now awaiting follow-up MRI in May to see if that's worked. UPDATE: MRI showed the cyst  had shrunk. Neuro-oncologist very happy and will see me after a repeat MRI Feb 2024 (a year after radiotherapy). Woop woop! 2024 UPDATE: MRI showed continued shrinkage, and neuro-oncologist still very happy. Next repeat MRI early 2025."

Six months into my retirement, in the middle of October, I had an angiogram and 8 days later, one day after my 60th birthday, I had a triple CABG at the excellent Basildon Cardiothoracic Centre.  \n\nLike just about everyone else, I didn't see my triple CABG coming.  I was in denial right up to the point the cardiologist told me I needed a triple bypass and that they were going to admit me immediately, and even then it took a bit of 'digesting'!  I have some family history but thought I was reasonably 'healthy'.  Like many, I was moderately active,  a little overweight, liked an occasional beer or glass of wine but I probably sat in front of one screen or another a little too much.  Even so, my blood pressure was in the normal range and I was taking a low dose statin for raised cholesterol, but nothing to write home about, at least so I thought.\n\nSo, now I'm something of a new man.  I exercise 5 days in 7, eat very healthily (and dropped out the cakes and biscuits), I've lost 8kg in weight and I'm fitter now than I have been in years.  After just 4 months (I'm writing this in February 2018), I'm back working (for myself), I've travelled long haul and life is beginning to feel 'normal'. I try not to take anything, certainly not my health, for granted.  I have to guard against trying to do too much and being some sort of superman.  I'm a work in progress and expect to be that for a very long time to come."

After the birth of my son the swelling in my feet and ankles slowly left me but it was a further 2/3 months before I could fit my feet into my own shoes again!\n\nBetween September 2018 and January 2021 (when I was diagnosed) I had a second child in March 2020 but continued to experience tiredness and feeling weak and occasions of my heart racing or feeling more prominent in my chest. I also had to have emergency surgery for a hiatus hernia in December 2020 but about 10 days after surgery when I was still experiencing palpitations I was sent for a chest X-ray and CT scan. My CT scan showed a dilation of my heart and I was referred for an echocardiogram. The day after this appointment I returned to A&E with shortness of breath and palpitations again after paramedics were called and my heart readings were showing that I was becoming tachycardic every time I readjusted my position, stood up or moved around. Later that evening I was admitted to CCU and the next morning my diagnosis was explained to me. My EF was 37% and I was told I had borderline severe heart failure and probable dilated cardiomyopathy. I was also told that I couldn\u2019t have any more children. I began medication and regular monitoring and my heart started to show signs of recovery and my EF increased to 58% which was fantastic news!!\n\nIn May 2021, 4 months later, I received the shocking news that I was in fact 20 weeks pregnant! In August 2021, my symptoms were rapidly getting worse and a repeat echocardiogram showed that I had lost 6% of my heart function in 1 week so the decision was made and my miracle made her way into the world at 32 weeks. \n\nIn November 2021 I had another repeat echocardiogram and it showed my EF had increased to 48%. I\u2019ve had a repeat echocardiogram in June 2022 and my EF was at 45% but I\u2019ve had a recent change to my medication (November 2022) so I\u2019m hopeful that things will improve soon and hopefully with less side effects."

As time passed I was diagnosed with vasospastic angina. The pain made more sense to me although it didn't change it. I was given the usual meds aspirin , nicorandil, a statin that I couldn't tolerate, isosorbide in steps up from 10mg I have now settled on 30mg twice daily, diltiazem 240xl, and ranolozine 500mg twice daily. It took 18 months of going to a&e in and out of hospital various times with no end in site. I am now coping a  lot better,  I know my triggers, cold, windy days, hot days, I could be stood in a  draught. In the early days I was so tired and if I was woken up out of a deep sleep I would be in really bad pain that wouldn't be eased with my gtn spray. I still get pain at rest and when I wake up but since having the drug ranolozine it has allowed me to get on with my life with some normality."

No real discussion with gp or cardiac nurse, just an email dropped in my inbox. \n\nUpdate: now had Angiogram which showed severe narrowing in 3 arteries and some veins. Being urgently referred to Glenfield hospital, Leicester for Triple/Quadruple bypass surgery. Feeling scared but grateful it's been found. God is my comfort.\n\nPush forward 5 months. After surgery I had a saddle pulmonary embolism, a thrombus in my heart and clots in both lungs.\n\n Recently found out my diaphragm isn't working due to nerve damage during surgery.\n\nFeb 23 had angiogram to be told none of my grafts have worked. Heartbroken. All that for nothing. Back to square one. Except now I have heart damage, messed up diaphragm, numbness from scars and sternum pain. \n\nWaiting to discuss the way forward. Feeling sad.\n\nNow had 4 stents in 3 arteries. Praying they stay tissue/clot free unlike my grafts. Got to stay positive.\n\nUpdate. Tests show Phrenic nerve was severed during surgery. Will always have a paralysed left sided diaphragm which means my breathing is compromised. \nSternum not healed."
