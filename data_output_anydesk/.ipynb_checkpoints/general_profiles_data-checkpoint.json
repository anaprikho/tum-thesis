        "bio": "Diagnosed by GP as possible PMR Nov 2022.  Classic pattern of hip, buttocks, thighs stiffness and pain, sides of knees and extreme debilitating fatigue, plus muscles became very tired after little effort.  Inflammatory markers not raised.  RA, lupus and fibromyalgia excluded.  Then Jan 2023, caught flu and triggered shoulder, neck and upper arm pain, unable to turn my head so started pred 15 mg Feb 2023 with miraculous results, completely free from pain and stiffness within hours.  After 15mg for 2 weeks, reduction to 10mg due to psych effects and then again after a week to 7.5 mg. In May reduced to 5mg as still suffering side effects.  Pain and stiffness did not start to return until 5 mg, but still 80-90% effective.  Extreme fatigue returned after dropping to 5 mg.  Vit D at 4,000 IU helped fatigue noticeably.\n\nI blame my PMR on years of work stress and personal trauma.  Became so ill May 2021, forced to stop work and take early retirement.  Now starting to suspect that viral infections trigger a flare in PMR symptoms and also possible strong dietary correlation.  Also learned, Do whatever makes you happy (if I had enough energy).\n\nWas always athletic and fit, ran, walked, cycled, swam, I had walked to 18,000 ft in the Himalaya when all this started.  Classic atopic family with asthma, eczema and hayfever allergies.  Have always had problems with my muscles, which I put down to sporting injuries and pattern of physio, osteopathic treatments. \n\nHard to say when my symptoms first started, possibly as long ago as 2003.  I can\u2019t pinpoint first flare, but stiffness and tiredness started in my early 40s, physio advised seeing a rheumatologist, but GP did not take very seriously.  Prescribed diclofenac, as effective as pred is now, but effectiveness only lasted a few weeks, so did not persist.  Since then, every few months, I have had a flare of same symptoms, stiffness, pain, fatigue, which lasts a few months and then disappears, although stiffness persisted.  I have an idea that the flares correlate to viral infections, but too long ago to be sure, or possibly stress.  Many visits to GP, but nothing done until GP in Nov 22.\n\nFirst really bad attack happened around 2007, could hardly walk due to stiffness and pain, coinciding with flare of eczema on my arms and severe GI symptoms.  GI symptoms investigated and nothing found so labelled IBS.  I suspected diet and tried FODMAPs diet, which helped GI symptoms.  Then eliminated wheat and the pain, stiffness, brain fog, palpitations, fatigue vanished within 48 hrs.  Have been gluten free since.  Though continued to get flares of PMR type symptoms; hip girdle and rotator cuff type pain.  Stopped work May 2021, at the time, I thought due to stress and mental health, but now know that there is an underlying physical reason.  Summer 22 was hell for me, for months could not get up stairs, classic PMR Donald Duck waddle, toddler stomp down the stairs and old person groaning noises to get me out of a chair.  Saw GP in Nov 22 as wondered why I was not recovering from what I thought was a stress burnout and that is when I got a tentative diagnosis.  New GP and first one to take it all seriously.  The flare was tapering off at the end of the year without treatment by the time I saw the GP, but I got flu in Jan 2023 and all the symptoms kicked off again.  The worst it has ever been.  This time, my neck, trapezoid and shoulders, upper arms affected aswell as the hip girdle, lower back and legs etc.  I was a complete mess and could hardly move, so finally gave in and went on the pred.  \n\nI can\u2019t say that the pred is wonderful for me, or that my quality of life is better.  The control of pain and stiffness is slightly better than taking ibuprofen, but I hate the way that pred makes me feel.  If I could stop the pred tomorrow, I would, in a heart beat.\n\nDiet seems to be majorly important for me.  I was prediabetic last year and when I was on the prediabetes diet, my symptoms were significantly better during that time.  When I went on pred, I went back to eating foods with low Glycaemic Index and my weight has been stable.  When I lapse, I have discovered that I am extremely sensitive to added sugar, alcohol less so, very reactive to fried high carb snacks like crisps and tortilla crisps with loads of additives.  I really suffer the next day and a day or so after lapsing.\n\nFor now, I am continuing with the pred and trying to taper, and at the same time continue to explore the diet.  I am certain that I have PMR, but I also suspect that my dietary intolerance might have worsened, exacerbating the PMR symptoms.  Lastly, many PMR sufferers are anaemic, so I plan to try some iron to see if that helps the debilitating tiredness.\n\nIn case you wonder about the screen nick, I tried about 20 names when I joined and each one I tried was already taken. I finally tried gimmestrength in frustration, which was also taken \ud83d\ude03, so this is what I ended up with.  It would seem that finding an acceptable user name to join the site is more difficult than finding a cure for PMR.\n\nUpdated 05 July 2023.\n\nBlood results from 5 Sept 2023:\nCRP less than 5 mg/l\nERS 14 mm/h\nRheumatoid factor less than 10 iu/ml\nAnti-nuclear factor negative (less than 1/100)\nIron, B12, folate and Vit D levels OK.\nT4 and TSH normal\nHb a1c 39 mmol/mol - so 9 months pred hasn't put me back in the pre-diabetes zone yet. \nWeight fairly stable but put on 2 or 3 lbs.\nFBC all within acceptable range.\nNeutrophils 7.84 (normal range 1.5-7.2) - slightly raised due to pred?\n\nSo on the face of it, I look pretty healthy.  So why do I feel so crap then?  I made a list of my symptoms and they covered 2 sides of A4.  Saw the nice lady GP today and she still thinks that my symptoms sound like PMR, but there is still some random stuff going on (dryness, worsening asthma and thyroid) that doesn't fully fit.  She is going to speak to rheumatology about possibility of Sjogrens and is also sending me for a neck scan to look at my thyroid.  Thyroid function was normal, but I have an enlarged painful thyroid gland, it seems.\n\nUpdated 27 Sept 2023.",

        "bio": "I had a brain scan through a work related annual physical that showed a mass on the brain.  After going to MD Anderson in Houston, they performed a surgical procedure through the top of my skull by removing a (appropriately 3 inch x 5 inch) bone flap from the top of my skull.  After returning home, I noticed some drainage that was discolored and went to the hospital to have it checked out.  Long story short, several surgeries (8) later most of which were subsequent infections due to the material that the Dr.  used to replace the bone flap (PEEK) I went to consult another physician and he advised me that the material is a good material for most people however once you get an infection from it you are prone to subsequent infections.   He did a surgical procedure by replacing the bone flap with a titanium mesh with titanium screws and that seemed to due the trick.  \nFast forward 6 months and they determined that the tumor returned and decided to do radiation therapy.  I received radiation for 6 weeks, 5 days/week.   After that, about a year later, the tumor was still there and they advised that a form of radiation called TruBeam was the best course of action.  It was a single treatment.  \n\nA month after that, I began to have effects such as loss of balance/coordination.  It was determined that I had lessons (areas of brain necrosis) on the brain that was causing this.  \n\nThey advised that I should treat with medication including infusions of avastin bi-weekly.   I have been doing those for the past 2-3 months with no significant improvement.  \n\nClose to 5 years later, I am still looking for suggestions.  Any help would be greatly appreciated",

        "bio": "Hi, I am the wife of a person with Parkinson\u2019s. He is now 60, diagnosed April 2018. 58.  We have been following this site since then, trialling every new thing that comes up on here that seems safe.\n\nHe has had many tests done through a naturopath at House of Health in Auckland including DNA analysis, blood tests, organic acids urine test, SIBO breath test, hair analysis for heavy metals, faeces test for bacteria, viruses and parasites. Naturopath used opus 23 to analyse DNA results.\n\nMy husband\u2019s genetic testing says he has a large requirement for b1, b2 and b6. He had an improvement to his facial expressions on B1 but after trialling various concentrations, up to 3 g per day he has now settled on 1000mg per day.  He takes mannitol, d-ribose, b2, and hardy\u2019s inositol, dissolved in water that he sips on throughout the day.   \n\nHe had been on mirtazapine for a few years which made him sleepy and apathetic. He weaned off that over 3 months last year but became extremely anxious and suicidal around Christmas 2018 and had to be treated by the acute mental illness hospital. They put him on sertraline and back on mirtazapine.  He was even worse on the sertraline and became agitated and had insomnia then the mirtazapine calmed him down again but he was back to being apathetic and sleepy.\n\nFinally I put him on Hardy\u2019s  daily nutrients in February and this has had the single biggest positive impact of anything he has tried yet including the pharmaceutical drugs.   Hardy\u2019s  is a clinic trialled, balanced vitamin and mineral supplement. He takes the sipper bottle with the extra vitamins in addition to the Hardy\u2019s product:\n\nhardynutritionals.com/produ...\n\nHe also takes Hardy\u2019s greens and probiotics, Restore Gold since January 2019,  fish oil, digestive enzymes before meals, ubiquinol, pqq.\n Citicoline cdp jarrows on 28/5/19. \nStarting to slowly wean off mirtazapine and sertraline over months. ( now down to 2 mg mirtazipine from 30mg. Using a jewellers scale to reduce by about 1.5 % per week. Sertraline still on full amount 50mg as decreasing it by just a small amount made him feel worse).\n\n1 november 19 now also taking celery seed extract (2 weeks) , niagen (6 weeks) astaxanthin on and off, shilajit(3 weeks), acetyl glutathione (5 weeks), l- carnosine (3 weeks), vinpocetine (1 week), and for roseacea lighthouse probiotics every second week, Allimed (garlic clinical strength) and berberine alternate weeks ( for a year) . \n\nUpdate 12 November 19 \n\nThe pharmaceuticals he Is on at the moment ( he is weaning off them) are mirtazapine, down to less than 2 mg from original 30mg and sertraline/Zoloft down to 40mg from 50mg. I have a jewellers scale and I am reducing these by a small percentage each week over many months and hope to have him off them again in 6 months. If he seems to feel a bit worse I will add a tiny bit extra back in and wait until he stabilises but so far so good!\n\nAt the moment he is feeling better than he has been for years, and is happy energetic and motivated. He is only on 1 C/L per day and we are going to phase that out and swap to mucuna.\n\nLatest supplements which I think have helped his progress lately are pathethine from NOW, and horny goat weed which has 10% icariin in it from planetary herbals which has really ramped up his energy, mood and motivation plus he seems interested in everything again and is busy organising outings, buying stuff, and interacting with people again. I feel we are on the right track. (He is still taking the above supplements too ). \n\nProbiotic trialing a new one. Lifestream advanced probiotics mood + immunity.  \n\nAlso 1/2 kinson C/l  tablet  which seems to have not much effect. He tried up to 3 a day but they make him feel sick so he has settled on 1/2 before breakfast.   Uridine with the C/L seems to help with nausea and juddering.   He is taking 2 mucuna dopa from  NOW with the C/L for 120mg more l-dopa. \n\n\nUpdate 14 feb 2020.  Stopped uridine for a while as he has been taking it a while and supposedly  it may have side effects long term.   kinson C/L still 1/2 per day, mucuna 1 per day,  sertraline/Zoloft down to 1/9 of a 50mg tablet, mirtazapine down to 1% of the original dose. Tried going offthe mirtazapine totally last week but felt bad so staying on this minuscule amount a bit longer.  Overall stable mood, no deteriation, not feeling sick all the time now, more energy, less apathy, but still funny walk, no arm swing, fingers don\u2019t work well.  Urination urgency decreased, libido improved, slight tremor when tired or stressed. No anxiety.\n\n\nNothing was really working until he started on the Hardy\u2019s daily nutrients. Within 3 days of starting the DEN he had a remarkable improvement.\n\nI think his initial thiamine regime topped up his thiamine deficiency but then started making him anxious. The Hardy\u2019s is topping up all the other vitamin and mineral deficiencies.\n\nPreviously I had been trying to replicate the Hardy\u2019s formula with individual doses of the vitamins and minerals and other supplements like nac, etc where they were available to buy separately but when I swapped them all out for the Hardy\u2019s product the difference was night and day. I am not sure if it is because Hardy\u2019s is Canadian made and quality tested where the other supplements are from places like China so the quality may not have been there or whether it is that the Hardy\u2019s DEN have traces of many minerals that can\u2019t be purchased separately. ( my husband had a heavy metal hair analaysis and his arsenic and mercury levels were at the top end of the low band so I was concerned the arsenic may have been from contamination in his previous supplements).\n\nAnyway I urge any of you who are taking a lot of the ingredients in this product individually to swap them out for this product.",

Treatment by the osteopath ( when i could finally see him) was ineffective. That's when i phoned the doctor. A physio diagnosed PMR over the phone. I had never heard of it but on Googling realised my symptoms matched. Started on 15mg of pred (plus a load of supporting pills) in August 2020 and a few days later was back to whizzing about feeling normal again. A typical story. Reduced quite well down to 4mg until a dose of Covid in April 2022 sent my body into tailspin. The Covid wasnt bad but the impact meant a big flare. I didnt know about sickday rules, flares or anything else and floundered around with no guidance, following my instincts as no real guidance. GPs were not well informed I realise now. An agonising pain in my knee like it had been hit by a hammer turned out to be an insufficiency fracture of the knee end of my femur (used to be called bone necrosis, not a nice thought). Now have tapered again to 4mg but feel rough most days and legs very stiff and painful but cant work out what is PMR, or four years of low levels of exercise, or other issues such a what seems to be an inflamed varicose vein in my lower leg which flares every week or two for a few days. Rheumatologist says to continue taking 4mg permanently. Doesn't think my adrenals will work again. Now take statins and blood pressure medication. Feel a mess generally as i try and problem solve my condition and what to do about it. Professionals not much help so employing trial and error methods",

        "bio": "My husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018. His PSA bounced around  between 4 and 6 then rose to 7 in late 2018. He had a RP in January 2019.  Gleason 4+3 with clean margins. There was an area of perineural invasion but supposedly no extension outside of the prostate. His PSA was undetectable for several years then over the past few years it has slowly risen from 0.01 to 0.2. His latest doubling time is 11 months. We started speaking with a RO earlier this year who suggested 6 mo ADT and 2 months later begin 35 salvage radiation treatment. This is suggested to begin shortly after he hit the 0.2  PSA level. So here we are faced with a very difficult decision.  His PSMA-PET scan last week (11/28/23) was negative. He has no symptoms. He is concerned about potential side effects of radiation.  The ADT that has been suggested is orgovyx and only for 6 months, so hopefully those SE's will be transient. But the short and long term SE's of radiation make it a tough choice for someone who is otherwise healthy, very active and not having any symptoms.  SO what is weighing heavily on him, is the question How much QoL will he have to give up in hopes of a possible \"cure\".  I should mention that we are going to try to schedule a second opinion from Cleveland clinic or Moffitt Cancer Center to help him make his decision on the best next steps. I am here to listen to everyone's stories and support my husband as best that I can.",

I used the drugs given by the doctors, but it did not work well for my medication, it did not help to relieve symptoms such as scrotum open wound, alpha, Erythema nodosum and pseudofolliculitis. As a health worker, I knew that there was no specific treatment for this disease, I had symptoms of Erythema nodosum in my lower extremities. This was the beginning of some of the rheumatic problems that formed the other symptoms of the disease. I was worried that I would have complications experienced by some other patients with the disease. In April 1988, I read many medical books to learn more about Behcet's disease, its symptoms and complications. I am very glad that there is a close relationship between the composite I made and the cause of the disease. It is a mixture that is used in pharmacology and has no side effects and provides radical treatment in terms of its pharmacodynamic properties and its physiological and biochemical properties. After applying it on myself, I definitely got rid of the disease. I haven't had any problems so far. It is very easy to explain this scientifically, I would like to meet with pharmaceutical companies that conduct research on Beh\u00e7et's disease. Hoping to apply the radical treatment of Beh\u00e7etin, not symptomatic; With all respect.",

Probably at limit of impact on quality of life but glad to be here nonetheless. \n\nPSA has been slowly rising over the past 9 months or so from virtually undetectable to 1.6 at latest review 27 Nov 23.\nOncology not concerned as yet but has indicated if it continues at this rate and when it reaches 4 then it will be time to look at other treatment options.  I am not wanting to \u2018worry twice\u2019 but I would like to have a good understanding of what the options are before that discussion.  Hoping that perhaps other options become available before then and can be included.\n\nWorried, of course but trying my best not to feel overwhelmed.  Worrying for the family too.",

I was on Ropinirole for years but suffered augmentation & had a very difficult withdrawal. I also tried gabapentin & pregabalin & Oxycontin but still had very severe RLS I pushed for buprenorphine & it has been miraculous. Zero RLS since I started it in July 2021. I am now Campaigning to get RLS taught to the medical profession & buprenorphine & methadone licensed in the UK for RLS.\nI take Buprenorphine 0.4mg (0.2 mg at 9 pm and 0.2mg at midnight). I take 25mg pregabalin to counter opioid panic attacks and 10mg cetirizine for opioid sweats. I also start an MS drug soon which is a chemotherapy. Hopefully it won't worsen RLS.",

However, my health has been suffering for years now and feels in steep decline of late. I've seen many specialists trying to find an answer to my problems Inc cardiologist, haematologist, neurologist, haematologist, gastroenterologist and currently endocrinologist. I've been diagnosed as heterozygous for  hemochromatosis but this shouldn't be causing my current issues. A long list of symptoms here, which I'm sure make me sound crazy:\n\n1. Fatigue - exercise is intolerable for my body. After exercise is when it hits me and daily tasks are even becoming difficult.\n2. High heart rate - it jumps up at the slightest movement and is even high when I'm sleeping now. Worse in the heat and with stress and definitely upon eating. On researching it often seems to have 'POTS' element to it.\n3. Pain /pressure in the RHS of my neck. Also noticed my head tilts to this side.\n4. 'Kidney' pains - dull aches, but sometimes sharp and seems to increase in line with HR and other issues.\n5. Blood pressure - increasing all the time. \n6. Brain fog - lots of cognitive issues and working memory is almost none existent.\n7. Eyes - bright lights cause me issues, and my pupils open and close when shining a light into them (pupilliary Hippus I believe it's called)\n8. Gastro problems - eating smaller meals helps, otherwise it increases HR significantly, feels very uncomfortable and food seems to stay in the stomach for hours. \n9. Abdominal pains - very sharp and random stabbing pains... These are sporadic and only last a second.\n10. Stress intolerance. \n11. Sleep problems - I can get to sleep fine, but wake at 2-3am and can't return to sleep. \n\nI've had many blood tests and the only significant clues I have currently are low cortisol and high ferretin so I'm pursuing those. I'm hoping I'm near to an answer so I can get back to enjoying life\ud83e\udd1e \n\nUPDATE: Found a knowledgeable cardiologist in Wigan recently who has put the pieces of the puzzle together... I'm very lucky to have found him. He's diagnosing me with hypermobility (potentially EDS(?)) with Dysautonomia... We need more tests to find out the exact types and systems that are affected. That's all I know so far, but will update as I go in case it's useful for others in future.",

I have had it on the mild side ever since but this year it has escalated to an alarming degree.  I am 69.  I have always been conscious of not eating sugar, going gluten free, eating healthy balanced food.  However this year, the only thing that allows me to sleep is a hot bath, hot shower or a barefoot walk on cold wet grass.  I tried Gabapentin and it did nothing for me.  Maybe the dose was too low at 100mg. However after reading that it can cause augmentation I am determined to try to cope without drugs, until they can invent one that does not make things worse in the long run which I think would cause me to go around the twist.  I don't get it in the day which is a blessing.   I seem to be able to get enough sleep most nights but wake up 2 - 3 times a night and have to treat with bath, or barefoot walk.  I am grateful to this community as there is great advice on so many issues.  I am especially interested in people's experience with natural cures.",

I now take hydroxchloroquine,prednisolone and mycophenolate amongst a ton of other meds for my heart and lungs.with hindsight I think I've had lupus alot longer I've always been a tired person and suffered alot of fatigue and over the years had various things no dr could diagnose.at one point I was told it was all in my head.ive had positive DS-DNA and ANA but these are currently negative.the thinking is now the lupus is responsible for my heart and lung problems.every day is a battle with fatigue,concentration,joint pain etc .my  spaniel keeps me moving through it all and gives that bit of unconditional comfort on bad days.being prone to pneumonia I hibernate in winter so lockdown has been a doddle as I'm expert at keeping occupied when I'm not having a sleep day that is .i cant work now i lost my job in jan 2015 as i worked in an high infection unit .keep smiling and we will get through",

        "bio": "Well, still trying to accept the fact that I am stage 4, giving that I am in great great shape (for now). As AI researcher, I like to look for everything that can give myself (and others) some hope! Oh I am an ex natural bodybuilder (I still work out quite hard for my age) so if you need tips I can try to help.\n\nAge 50 (1973)\nDiagnosed with stage 4 on 23/08/2023 with PSA = 70, small bone metastasis (>4) and lymph node metastasis\n- Started straight away with Casodex (20 days) then started Decapeptyl on 09/09/2023 and continued with Casodex to avoid tumor flare\n\nOn 28/09/2023 my PSA = 15, and I started with ARASENS protocol: ADT (Decapeptyl) + Docetaxel (6 cycles) + Darolutamide\nPSA\n3 after first chemo infusion\n1.5 after second chemo infusion\n1.01 after the third chemo infusion \n1.8 after the fourth chemo infusion but measured under different conditions (strenuous workouts for two days in a row, one week after chemo instead of 3 weeks as usual)...scared like hell\n0.4 after the fifth chemo...thank God\n0.39 after the sixth chemo! (3 weeks after the chemo, 01 Feb 2024)\n0.07 (28 March 2024)\n0.05 (9 May 2024)\n0.06 (13 June 2024, they say normal fluctuations)\n0.03 (08 Aug 2024) \n0.03 (05 Sept 2024)\n0.02 (31 Oct 2024)\n0.01 (28 Nov 2024)\n\n\nTestosterone level on 01 Feb 2024: 0.33 nmol/L\nTestosterone level on 13 June 2024: 0.50 mol /L, again they said normal fluctuations\nTestosterone level on 31 Oct 2024. 0.33 nmol/L\n\nLast PET scan (13 June) says I am still in remission, metastasis are still decreasing after almost 6 months without docetaxel.\n\n\nWaiting for my genetic tests to come back (they came back...see below).\n\nI proposed ARASENS to my MO but he already wanted to do it and convinced Bayer to add me to the trial after a good fight! I hope it's the best decision, looking at their numbers it is, it should give me at least 5 years without progression (hopefully) and in 5 years god knows which new treatments will be available...at least I hope!\n\nMy supplement plan is as follows:\n\nGeneral health supplements:\nI use vegan high-quality protein powder after workouts, a practice I've maintained throughout my 32 years of heavy-duty workouts (though not as intense lately!). I only consume it in moderation. On workout days, I aim for 0.8-1.0 g of protein per kg of ideal weight. \nRecommendation: The \"per kg of body weight\" indicated on labels can be misleading. Someone might weigh 100 kg with 40% fat or 100 kg with 5% fat. If you only consider body weight, you might end up feeding fat in the former case.\n\nGeneral health/microbiome:\nA healthy gut appears to be associated with better cancer treatment outcomes and is certainly linked to overall health. I enjoy vegetables and have recently added: pomegranate juice (around 100ml almost daily without a fixed schedule), homemade sauerkraut (occasionally store-bought), miso soup (when I remember), boiled beetroot with beans, and I try to consume as much fiber as possible (including a teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa powder).\n\nChemo/adt therapy: I avoid supplements 48 hours before and 72 hours after chemo. This is a precaution to prevent any interference with the treatment or PSA readings. Many studies suggest substances like curcumin can enhance chemo, but these studies are mostly conducted on cells or mice. Since 90% of such research fails when tested on humans, I weigh the risks: potential benefits against potential harm. I choose to err on the side of caution. I wait 72 hours for docetaxel to be fully ineffective before resuming supplements.\nMy only strategy during chemo is fasting or consuming very low calories (300-400/day) 48 hours before and 24 hours after treatment. This is based on clinical experiments by Valter Longo (you can look him up). I do this primarily to minimize side effects, though it's believed to also protect healthy cells.\n\nClose to chemo sessions (not too close, as mentioned above), I take:\n\nCurcumin and ursolic acid in small doses, twice a day for now. Their antioxidant properties are beneficial for general health. After completing chemo, I plan to reduce this to once daily.\nUPDATE post-chemo: I take curcumin, green tea and resveratrol. I quit ursolic acid, I want to switch supplements from time to time. Plus I added sulforaphane and also spirulina (and I eat mre broccoli lately!). \n\nSilymarin from milk thistle, 240mg daily, starting 48-72 hours post-chemo and stopping 48 hours before the next session. As chemo affects the liver, I use this to aid its recovery. I'll continue using it in the future but for shorter durations.\n\nA combination supplement of calcium, zinc, magnesium, and D3 + K. Calcium, zinc and magnesium are not high doses and don't provide 100% RDA of any component. I planned to stop these supplements once done with chemo, but I am on someta now, so my MO wants me to take D3 and K2 and to make sure I have enough calcium, so I am still supplementing.\n\nMelatonin: I consume 4mg daily for sleep. I came across a Russian clinical study (from a reputable source, in 2012 at least!) suggesting potential long-term survival benefits with a 3mg nightly dose. They administered it to participants only during summer, but I speculate this is because Russians naturally produce more melatonin during their shorter winter days.\n\nCBD oil: for fun!\n\nI got married on the 7th of November 2023, on the 8th I discovered I have an ATM gene mutation\u2026it has nothing to do with cash!",

        "bio": "Hi, I'm in the UK and turned 51 this year.\nDX early July 2024 - PSA 530 \nShock to the system because zero symptoms. \nThanks to my girlfriend who made me get a general check up. \nMRI, CT & transPerineal biopsy revealed low volume metastatic PC (spread to lymph nodes but not the bones). \nGleason 7 (4+3). \nWas immediately put on Degarelix (Firmagon)\nHot flushes and a bit of fatigue - but mild SEs so far.\n6 weeks later PSA dropped to 0.88\nI'm now a week into Enzalutamide (Xtandi). Hot Flushes have increased. \n\nI'm also experimenting with supplements. I've spent last 6 weeks reading medical studies & trials \nof various herbs/berberine/black seed oil/etc etc. It's a minefield with info pointing in all directions. \n\nA friend with a difficult to treat cancer eventually refused chemo/radio/surgery. Instead \nwent on a vegan diet, and took various supplements, homeopathic and otherwise. I thought he was ill-advised to \ntake that route... Within two years his cancer was gone. That's 12 years ago now, and he's still fit and well. \n\nSo, I've decided to go the full treatment route but incorporating diet/supplements etc. \nI've gone full vegan/wholefood/organic (Wondering about fish for omega 3). I eat between noon and 8pm. \nCramming in as many anti-inflammatory cancer fighting foods as possible - Cruciferous veg, broccoli sprouts, Curcumin, Beets, pomegranate, etc etc. \nI was a bit over weight but not much... my diet was ok... all home cooked, but lots of eggs and lots of dairy... cream, cheese, yogurt.  I exercised - but not as much as I maybe should have. \nI now get at least 30 mins vigorous exercise daily (mainly swimming), and try to add between 7000/10000 steps throughout the day, so I'm not too sedentary. Exercise feels like medicine. Cold showers too... anti-inflammatory. \n\nI've been reading this forum for a few weeks now and massively appreciate all you guys \nfor how you all handle it... with humour... and with grace. Sharing knowledge seems key. Tho I know everyone doesn't always agree! We're all in the same crappy boat... using whatever paddles we can lay our hands on.  \n\nWhat supps I'm taking; (Or, intend to take... time and cost means I'm on about a third of the below, I find as each runs out, I follow my gut about what to keep going and what to phase out.)\nBlack seed oil, Berberine ,Pomi-T, Zyflamend, Resveratrol, Boswelia, Sage leaf extract, Dandelion Tea, Peppermint oil caps,  Vit D3, occasional B12 (because vegan), Aspirin (75 mg every other day), Omega 3 (every other day), Pharmaceutical CBD oil to help sleep, Probiotic capsule, Ground Flaxseeds, 1 tsp Curcumin extract mixed with black pepper & oil. \nI'm considering adding a few more, and may take some of the above away (any advice welcomed); Liposomal Quercetin, Vit K2, Turkey Tail (Fruiting body or Mycelium??), Reishi mushroom, Theracumin, Grape seed extract, Ellagic acid, Sutherlandi Frutscens, Indole 3 carbinol, Sulfurophane, modified citrus pectin, Melatonin, 1tsp bicarb soda daily, Genistein, Silibinin, Triphala (Ayurvedic), grape seed extract.\n\nI'm also thinking about traditional Chinese medicine, to use in tandem with 'western' medicine... quite a few studies point to it increasing efficacy.  But... haven't explored any further. \n\nCurrently 3 months in, on Degarelix & Enzalutamide. PSA down to 0.03... side effects minimal for now. I'm exercising a lot, weights and cardio, and am hoping this is keeping S/Es to a minimum. Radiotherapy to prostate coming up in Jan/Feb.\n\nAnyway, that's about it... thank you... I appreciate you guys!",

        "bio": "My RLS symptoms started when I was in college. However, symptoms did not become severe enough to seek medical attention until I was 32 and living in NYC. Working as a film editor required me sit in a dark room for long periods of time. It sometimes became very challenging to do my job without jumping out of my skin. But I also believe that staring at images moving quickly on a monitor sometimes worked to relax my legs. I know that video games can have that  effect. At other times the symptoms were just too severe to sit still and I would have to take a walk. \n\nSevere symptoms or perhaps augmentation started about 7 years ago. After napping in the editing room (a common practice in my world because of the extremely long working hours) I would wake feeling horrible all over my body. It's difficult to describe the pain. Perhaps like a bad flu without the fever. After being awake for an hour or so the symptoms would subside.\n\nThese symptoms became so severe that I sought out a specialist in RLS. About 5 years ago. This was the first time I heard about augmentation. My neurologist suggested I stop taking Mirapex cold turkey. That didn't work. In fact , I had days 5 of the worst RLS symptoms I had ever experienced. 24/7. After 25 years of RLS  I was already sleep deprived, but this was extreme. I did not sleep for 4 day.s When I started falling asleep  walking I ended my attempt at getting off Mirapex. Too dangerous. My neurologist then put me on Neuupro. For 6 months I was almost free of symptoms. All the old triggers even disappeared. But then the augmentation started again. Over time Itried different dosages of Mirapex and pregabalin to deal with the symptoms, but things went from bad to worse. \n\nIn the meantime, I had moved to Brasil to be closer to my wife's family. A lot of the responsibilities for moving fell on my wife because I was often incapacitated from lack of sleep.  My symptoms continued to get worse. It became common for me to be awake 24 hours 2 days a week. And then the burning started. It felt I had a very severe sunburn on different parts of my body. The burning happened during the day, at night. Anytime. I was at my wit's end. \n\nLong story made a little shorter, I discovered this site and my neurologist suggested Buprenorphine at about the same time. It has saved my life. Soon I will be free of dopamine agonist completely and hopefully living my life less burdened by RLS.\n\nTrying to withdraw from Neupro and suffering moderate to severe augmentation and rebound.",

Our financial position has allowed us to research and find and meet some of the best Professors and doctors for RSL\n\nLast year we spent just under $50,000 on this journey and finally hit gold in Dr Glen Brooks and Professor Winkleman I spent money on others but they were stuck on antiquated medications and thinking .\n\nYou name it I\u2019ve tried it !\n\nMy last regime was\n\n15 mg slow release oxycodene at night plus 10 mg endone which is fast acting earlier in the day if out for dinner or movies etc plus stillnox. I have been on as high has 20 mg oxycodone earlier on .\n\nResult was\n\nOnly got 4 hours sleep per night .\n\nI thought about suicide all day everyday .\n\nMy memory was as if I had Alzheimer\u2019, I couldn\u2019t read , write as I could not spell .\n\nLife gave me no pleasure at all , I could not enjoy conversation as I could not remember what was said . I became very quite and withdrawn and was scared to do anything I hated the thought of travel or socialising the opposite of everything I have ever been . My children were very concerned as was my husband .RSL and meds consumed every second of my life as it does for all who are not on medication that works .\n\nMedication for RSL should be like taking a blood pressure pill should . Take it and forget about it for 24 hours !\n\nA lot of people on this website are given a medication it does not work properly then the doctor adds another bandaid more drugs and it goes on .\n\nThe day before my trip to see Dr brooks in NYC the Dr in Australia wanted to add amitriptyline to my cocktail let\u2019s keep adding in my eyes this is criminal .\n\nDr Glen Brooks reached across the table with 2 hands placed them on mine and said LETS MAKE YOU WELL AGAIN ! That is how it should be don\u2019t just be a prescriber CARE think about the problem I was problem solving all day everyday in my companies . If you don\u2019t know don\u2019t send them to neurologist who do not know either and trust me can do no harm . If the Success runs are not on the board don\u2019t play with people\u2019s lives .\n\nThe internet has saved my life and having the funds to follow through with my research .\n\nDoctors can contact Dr Glen Brooks or Dr Winkleman other doctors and clarify the use of buprenorphine .\n\nFor me it was a clean swap no down time .\n\nPrescribed was 2 mg sublingual wafer under the tongue at bedtime\n\nI take half a dose 1 mg\n\nSlept like a baby I did not move my husband could not believe it\n\nIt has a 24 half life now I take a little less than 1 mg\n\nWhich means my script gives me double the quantity.\n\nMost people need 2 mg\n\nProfessor Winkleman said it never needs increasing it is one of the safest drugs and the doctors should be pleased if the RSL patients are on it because you cannot become addicted nor overdose or take opioids on it as it stops them from working .\n\nI am back to my old self on every level I take my 1 mg when I\u2019m in bed and ready to sleep no break through , just like taking a blood pressure tablet set and forget . I take NO OTHER MEDS just the buprenorphine\n\nPs I\u2019m asleep in minutes\n\nTruly hoping more Doctors will trail this I was on a 10 day trail with Dr Glen Brooks and I have not looked back .\n\nAll the best please let me me know how you go wishing you success , peace and good health \ud83d\ude42\n\nPS If you see my writing about temgesic it is also buprenorphine with only a 5 hour half life and only in micrdose 0.2 subliqual wafers. I have to take anything from 6 to 10 Temgesic wafers to get a similar result from one small less than 1mg buprenorphine.\n\nnot a patch of just buprenorphine\n\nIn australia they only will prescribe Temgesic unless you lie and say you are a drug addict and collect drugs every 7 days from a drug clinic and declare that you are drug abuser on all entry froms into other countries when travelling .So I tend to resort back to buprenorphine which I bring back from the USA and then my world is 99 percent normal and the other 1 percent is buprenorphine which makes me whole again.\n\nAll the best 100 percent I would recommend trying buprenorphine from my experience\n\nUPDATE \nI started  buprenorphine October 29 Th 2019\nI sleep 8/10 hours undisturbed  rarely waking for the bathroom \nProfessor John Winkleman said that I obviously don\u2019t have insomnia , some RLS  suffers have both conditions.\nNow I sleep my body is becoming healthier and healthier each month.\n16 years I was on blood pressure medication and heading to kidney failure my GP \nsaid which is I why I went to the USA from Australia for answers.\nAmazingly after careful monitoring of my what had become low BP my GP has ceased \nmy blood pressure medication.\nProfessor Winkleman said that RLS is far more dangerous that sleep Apnea.\nMy prescribed dose is 2 mg , mostly I only take Img however when I exercise I have to \nIncrease it to 2 mg for a couple of days until my hands , fingers and legs return to normal.\nSo as you can see there has been no tirating up.\n\nProfessor Richard Allen from John Hopkins , Professor Jon Winkleman from Boston and Dr Glen Brooks from NYC all say it is really important to NOT have Naloxone add buprenorphine because it is not effective for RLS.\nBUPRENORPHINE is also used to treat refractory OCD.\nIf anyone from the UK is going to start in Temgesic start is slow it is a much lower however for some reason some people get sick as I did . So take your first one late don\u2019t wait until bedtime to take your first dose . If your legs are restless then add another , you will know when you\u2019ve had enough because your legs stop. \nI was fortunate to do a straight switch with the medication I was on others will no doubt need to wean.\nJules1953 would be great for anyone to talk to who is taking temgesic and weaning off other meds \nAbsolutely amazing 1 x 200 mcg is all she has needed and she sleeps 8 / 10 hours also.",

December 2023 PSA 18 (8 years to change from 6!), had rectal ultrasound, PI-RAD5 rated 21mm tumor discovered, urologist said he would cut it out, I said no F'ing way.  I refused biopsy so instead radically changed my diet to vegan, taking many supplements, lost 60 lbs. and still feeling fine now 13 months later after no more stress accepting my fate, doing intermittent fasting, walking daily, no symptoms.  Sexual function fine at 65 and more important than length of life.  Not going to live to 80 and be a Eunuch like those who choose ADT.  Read the horror stories here yourself,  it's truly sad the damage that is done to QOL and my heart goes out to all who are suffering.   I am living each day to the fullest- and still have not seen any Doctors. Why risk being damaged? 35-50% ED rate after treatments and zero libido on ADT.   Choose wisely who to trust here on these forums and self proclaimed experts or the medical industrial complex- get 12 specialists opinions and you will get 12 different answers, if you value your sex life and are under 60- be careful.  Question any responses from those forums mod's sponsored by big pharma.",

I have no desire to be a lifelong client to this medical system where I pay as a patient for services indefinitely. I don't see myself going through the pharmacy drive-thru until I die meanwhile paying the top paid profession for medical help that doesn't give me my freedom and doesn't eliminate this disease. They're no heroes of mine. Only money and fame driven people. \n\nI recommend this book: \"Your Consent is not Required\" by Rob Wipond. Please read. \n\nI am also a NAMI member. I hear from many others how expensive and ineffective healthcare is here.",

Woke in the night unable to turn over. As for getting dressed - itwas agony. Getting legs in jeans, pulling on a jumper, getting upstairs\u2026\u2026..\nChanged anti depressant to Venlafaxine @October, then took Ibuprofen on top of that. Ended up with similar issues to when I was given Clopidogril years back. Had a bit of breakthrough spotting from that. It stopped when I switched back to Aspirin. Stopped both of them just now. Since my recent blood tests I\u2019ve gone back to previous anti depressant , Paroxetine 10mg. Spotting/leakage seems to have eased quite a bit. \nBlood tests came back on 21/12 21 - raised CRP and ESR levels. GP has put me on 15mg of Prednisilone. I started it 22/12/21 - it\u2019s made a big difference, thank goodness. I\u2019ve been a bit round the bend worrying about myself because I didn\u2019t know what was wrong. Im now trying to calm down and find out more about this. Very glad to have found this forum. Phew!!",

Dr. Lin at UW/Fred Hutch says they don't recommend salvage treatment until 0.2)\nuPSA at 26 months 0.03\n\nOther medical/physical data:\n\nBMI hovers around 22.\n\nModerate high blood pressure and cholesterol (on moderate dose 25mg Losartan and 20mg Simvastatin)\n\nDiet: Flexitarian (mostly about 75% plants/fruits (mostly veggies) and 25% animal (mostly fish/shellfish with small amounts of lean chicken/beef/pork - indulge occasionally (couple times a month) in a burger or steak.)  \n\nAlcohol: Inconsistent. 0-3 servings daily probably averages out to 2 glasses a wine a day per week = 14 servings.  This is typically considered a NO NO for cancer survivors but I decided to live with the risk and try to minimize by sticking to 90% red wine due to potential benefits of the resveratrol. Recent news about alcohol and cancer has me considering trying to get closer to 7 servings a week.\n\nExercise: Best described as inconsistent: 1-3 X 0.5-1 hour per week (both resistance and cardio) in many cases much higher (from skiing or mountain biking).  Getting more consistent on closer to 3 times a week due to apparent BCR starting.\n\n16-hour fast every day (don't eat breakfast) and take 100mg dihydroberberine 30 min before lunch and dinner (for glucose metabolism and anti-metastatic potential - dihydro form has been shown to have better bioavailability and is equivalent to roughly 500mg+ regular berberine with larger AUC for blood levels.)\n\nD3 60,000 IU weekly Winter 50,000 IU weekly Summer (D3 blood level tests 1-2 times a year have been between 40 and 60 (about right on target.)  Surprising that such high doses are required to get to those levels.\n\n+ K2 MK-7 100 mcg daily and ~5mg MK-4 3 times a day.  Significant data on K2 anti-cancer potential and required to prevent coronary calcium buildup due to the high D3 intake. Note (MK-4 has a very short half life and MK-7 has a very long half life and is converted to MK-4)\n+ 1/2 baby aspirin (40 mg) daily for anti-metastatic potential with no significant effect on blood clotting.\n+  600 mg Calcium at lunch and 400 mg Magnesium Citrate and 7.5 mg zinc at bed for lack of intake in my diet after 1-month dietary analysis (I don't consume any dairy except an occasional pizza - don't like it.) Note only much higher levels of zinc or insufficiency have been shown to be potentially pro-cancer\n+ 3 mg Melatonin in Winter and 5mg Summer for antioxidant-based anti-cancer potential (considering switching to high dose, and or doing low-dose in the morning to increase Mel/Cortisol ratio during daytime but preserve Circadian Rythm by using high does at night?)\n+ Pomegranate Extract (Ellagic Acid 2X250mg =500mg) only prior to drinking alcohol due to evidence it reduces alcohol toxicity.",

        "bio": "Cleveland region. DRE detected lump summer 2009. Biopsy. Gleason 7(3+4)T2. ADT and IGRT gave nadir of 0.8.  ADT likely produced cognition issues.  My lab notebooks bear witness.  Biochemical recurrence in 2015 and salvage brachytherapy that summer.  Side effect has been stress incontinence. Nadir 1.2. Biochemical recurrence in 2017.  Did not want Lupron Depot And took spironolactone for blood pressure, minimize T, and postpone the inevitable.  \nStopped spiro early March 2020. It is a diuretic and antagonistic to vesicare and made stress incontinence more frequent. Also wanted to bump up my T to help my immune system with Covid 19 rampant in the land. PSA went from 2.7 to 5.4 in two months.  Went to Lupron Depot to lower PSA.  3.4 then 3.7 four months later.  Flucovine PET Jan. 2021 shows seminal vesicare uptake and nowhere else.  Interviewing  medical oncologists with office in Cleveland Western suburbs.  Since I had RT with ADT, then recurrence, then salvage brachytherapy I'm cautious about additional radiation treatments by same group (0 for 2).  Maybe time for a new RO.  New clinic.  Gamma knife?  Proton beam?  Does only hot spot at seminal vesicles suggest it remains confined?  Started bicalutamide following Auximin PET.  Big decrease in PSA. Fractional values.  After 18 months with bicalutamide mono therapy have tingling/numbness in pinky and ring finger of left hand. PSA remains below 0.1. Fingers work fine. Tingling is peripheral neuropathy treated with B12 injections and D vitamins.  July of \u201823 slight uptick in PSA. December \u201823 PSA 0.9. Stopped bicalutamide. Had a UTI which can cause false PSA. Antibiotics for UTI. Feb. \u201824 PSA still 0.9. March of \u201824 PSA 1.1; T=363.  June \u201824 PSA 1.6, T=333.  Appears my Lupron \u2018vacation\u2019 is over.   Will likely try more ADT.  Visit Doc July 3. Well, major surgery March 15 2024 due to bowel perforation and sepsis resulting in an ileostomy.  Perforation in same region as colonoscopy observed radiation proctitis and argon laser ablation in \u201820.  Much sedation and 3 month rehab. Received Lupron July \u201824. PSA up to 2.7 in October \u201824. DT 4.8 months. An Ict. \u201824 Gallium PSMA negative except around prostate bed. nmCRPC?  Visited two uro\u2019s neither willing to order a CTC or darolutamide. Lupron Nov 14, 2024. Should keep my T down I suppose. Visiting an RO and also referred to Steve Campbell at Cleveland Clinic. Campbell asked me to see Clinic RO and MO. The MO, Moshe Ornstein, ordered prostate MRI (no spread to adjacent organs or bones) and ctDNA (no accepted markers). He took my case to the tumor board and consensus is no focal options left and time to try Nubeqa wit Lupron. Nubeqa starting 1/9/2025. Feb. 13, 2025 PSA has fallen to 0.12!  Nubeqa doing its job despite concerns that ileostomy may hinder absorption.",

That was nearly 25 years ago and I have come to realise that there are more options for treatment now. \nI find the unpredictably and  anticipation of the episodes harder than actually going through them.\nI was very symptomatic when diagnosed with near syncope for a few times  and it took me a long time to get used to the medication. Once I did I was doing fairly well with only a few episodes a year, but I still found that my dosage of 2.5 mg Bisoprolol twice a day makes me very sluggish.  Apixaban has made me lose a lot of hair and makes other medical procedures more complicated, but I am grateful.\n\n2024 after two bouts of Covid (might be a red herring) the frequency of episodes has increased and I was more willing to consider the offered ablation. Mostly because I realised that that option would become less viable if I went to permanent AF and if I  was older. I had my ablation only 3 days ago and had a rough episode yesterday with both AF and what looks very much like a flutter, so early days yet. \nThis forum has been such a help although I do sometimes feel that I might now know  too much about this horrible condition and certainly more than most GPs and have found that it\u2019s certainly true that nobody likes a know-all.",

Consultant immediately sent her to A&E where she was admitted with a HR touching 200 BPM. She self reverted on the ward early the next day. Put on Bisoprolol for AF, and Rivoxyban for anti clotting. \n\nAug 2019: Admitted to hospital when PAF episode went on for over a weak and had pains in chest. Cardioversion abandoned when it put her in dangerous flutter. Week in hospital trying various combinations of Bisoprolol and Digoxin. AF declared permanent and discharged...she self reverted same day. \n\nNov 2019: 3 month follow up removed Digoxin\n\nDec 2020 : Resting HR dropping regularly to low 40s. GP reduced Bisoprolol to 1.25g. Slight improvement to resting HR.\n\nMay 2021: multiple AF episodes since start of year.  GP increases Bisoprolol to 2.5 mg.\n\nApril 2023: Went into persistent AF. GP increased Bisoprolol to 5mg and then 7.5 mg. Then changed to atenalol.\n\nMay 2023: Saw consultant at NDDH.  Beta blocker changed to Nebivolol 7.5mg.\n\nDec 2024: Phone consult with AF nurse. Reported shortness of breath. Put on diuretic (Furosemide 40mg). Follow up call in Jan, reported still shortness of breath.  Echo cardiogram ordered and put on heart failure medication (Dapagliflozin 10mg).\n\nFeb 2025: Echo cardiogram performed and showed heart failure with EF of 35%. Referred to heart failure clinic in March.",

Four months later, we got her checked again, and it was found that she had gallbladder stones. The pain has stopped, but the tightness is still there. Later, the doctor said that while removing the stone, they found TB in her abdomen. She took TB medicine for 6 months, but there was no relief. Even after giving her psychiatric medication, there\u2019s been no improvement. We are unable to understand what the problem is. All the reports come back normal.

However I have been struggling for 5 years before that and was told it was because of the Menopause. Had lots of symptoms including weight gain, brain fog, muscle pain and even swallowing problems.   All which made me feel even worse than I have ever felt in my life. \nUpdate May 2021\nI'm still struggling whether it be thyroid related or low cortisol and dhea.  The latter I'm being tested for.  I am beginning to think that I will never get better but not for the want of trying. \n\nUpdate 28/01/2022\nI was finally diagnosed as having secondary adrenal insufficiency around November 2021 due to long term opiate medication. Been put on hydrocortisone 20mg daily.  \nStill feeling really ill.\n\nUpdate 13/12/2023\nWell all I can update is how ill I still feel. \nI am paying private for menopause treatment at Newson Menopause clinic in Stratford upon Avon. \nMy symptoms of hypothyroidism and Menopause apparently cross over. \nHowever nothing is ever plain sailing as it seems I am having trouble absorbing estrogel and different estrogen patches through my skin. \nThey don't really know why but think my EDS hypermobility and hypothyroidism and maybe secondary adrenal insufficiency could be the cause. \nRight now I'm frightened as it just feels like I'm slowly dying and often think what's the point. \nI tried to see a private endocrinologist who actually  didn't take me on as he thought I was too complicated. I respected him as he could have just taken  my money. \nHe said I needed someone who could deal with thyroid, adrenal and Menopause  hormones. \nI have looked and I just can't find anyone. I'm slowly giving up.",

These increased when I went to 9 mg (in early December). Nothing debilitating, but they are noticeable. Contacted rheumie who said to stay at 9 mg until I saw her in January. We met yesterday, and I reported that aches and pains slightly worse over the last month, so she's put me back at 11 mg, and if all goes well, to start tapering by 1 mg per month. I also realized I've been eating poorly in last couple of months and not taking the time for daily rest and/or meditation, which I had been doing at the start of all this. And that can't help. So going to focus on both those in coming weeks.\nAugust  15, 2024: On advice of rheumie, have gone back up to 17.5 mg daily dose for one full month, as I\u2019ve continued a bit achey and inflamed since dropping to 15 mg. Symptoms have improved.\nLater in July 2024: Saw  rheumatologist, as my GP was concerned about a couple of things (weight loss  and relative youth (how great at age 59 to be considered young)). Rheumie ran a few more blood tests and confirmed  PMR diagnosis. Advised to stay at 15 mg until mid-August, and then drop  2.5 every 4 weeks  until I get to 10, at which point I will see her again.\nMid-July 2024: Continued taper with move to 15 mg. Noticed  increase in hip tightness and arm fatigue, which has persisted. Nothing close to the pre-prednisone stiffness, but am taking occasional acetaminophen (Tylenol) for it.\nEarly July 2024: Started taper, moving to 17.5 mg. First week a bit rocky but then fine. \nJune 5, 2024: Until 6 weeks ago, I felt like I was a pretty healthy 60-year old, all things considered. Then bang out of nowhere came hip stiffness and pain; great difficulty in getting up from seated,  out of bed, and leaning over to tie up my shoes; as well as sore arms, stiff neck, and unbendy knees. Plus I realized I had lost my appetite and lost  weight \u2014  not unwelcome, but strange.  Plus I have had a rash around my mouth since February, which I had assumed was triggered  by my new CPAP mask but now wondering if it was part of my  immune system going out of whack.  In early June, got diagnosis of PMR, based on my symptoms,  a good response to trial run of prednisone, and blood test results showing  high inflammatory markers and no indication of RA, lupus, or Lyme.",

Had it not been for receiving a brain MRI two months earlier and one of my legs swelling up due to a crushed ureter. It would have probably been over before it started. When I visited my oncologist two months later, my pelvis and one of my butt cheeks was hurting; they gave me a Degarelix shot, then followed up a month later with a Lupron shot, started me on abiraterone and my first round of Docetaxel. Saturday, a week later after chemo, my wife found me unable to get out of bed on a weekend with a fever of 101 and I had fallen during the night, somehow managing with all my strength to pull myself off the floor. She immediately called an ambulance as my oncologist said a fever could be deadly for a cancer patient. During the trip to ER. my BP was 80/60. My wife was unable to get to  the hospital as she could not leave her mother and did not see me for two days. Upon seeing me she told the supervision, this is not the man she knew. I was at the hospital three or four days. \n\nThank God they were able to get me in time, my urologist said another six hours and I wouldn\u2019t have made it. Two days after being discharged I went back into the ER for suspected stroke, was held for observation. one brain MRI. two CT scans. half a dozen neurologists,  and a week after that I went back to ER with severe bleeding resulting from a problematic stint. They were unable to diagnose exactly what was going on. \n\nSince then I recovered somewhat after flunking chemotherapy. My tumors in my bulky lymph nodes shrunk about 70 percent four months after diagnosis. Ten months after diagnosis, a bone scan and CT scan revealed that my tumors had shrunk some marginally another ten percent and my pelvis spot was less sclerotic \n\nWithout the Lord watching over me and the prayers and support of many, many people,  I would not be here in early 2024, nearly 19 months after my first manifestation of symptoms with my left leg blowing up due to the crushed ureter. Thank you Lord for your mercy and please extend it to my friends I have met here. \n\nTo be continued!",

Came round within a few seconds, felt nauseous,  spaced out, tired but didn't call ambulance as Covid-19 was being focused on & was told don't call unless life or death situation. Called the surgery the following morning. Fobbed off by GP. Persisted  the following week as didn't feel well. Eventually referred to Cardiology. Loop recorder implanted July 2020. Picked up SVTs, ectopic beats, small palpitations episodes but nothing that would cause a collapse until October 2021. Started with very strong palpitations which felt \"different\". Went to get my Patient Assist, started to collapse and things started to go black. Managed to grab something to stop my fall. Felt exactly the same after as my Apr 2020 collapse.  Consultant confirmed Atrial fibrillation picked up on the loop recorder.  Consultant asked my GP to prescribe bisoprolol but they didn't. Other episodes followed resulting feeling spaced out, tiredness etc. GP was asked again to prescribe but nothing materialised.  Eventually got my prescription. Dose was low but unfortunately didn't react too well to it. Various side effects. Further discussion with Consultant and currently waiting to go in for EP study with the view of carrying out an ablation within the next few weeks.",

Started Firmagon and Aberaterone and then had orchiectomy in about October 2021. Imaging showed some bone mets and two lymph nodes which were biopsied and are positive for cancer of prostate origin. Recently I have apparently become castrate resistant since there is radiographic progression and a fairly rapidly doubling of PSA.Recently had a pathological fracture right where the biggest bone met is. Considering LU 177 but need to get in a trial since I have not had chemo at this point and would prefer to not. Have an appointment in about a month with a really good oncologist (not crazy about my current one or his nice but unresponsive staff) and hope he can give me a better plan of action.\n\nStarted chemo doxytaxel third infusion in about a week.\nFinished chemo and after a couple of months PSA started to rise. Last increase had doubling rate of .9 months.Also had CT and bone scans which show radiographic progression. Have a PSMA pet scan in a few days to determine suitability of Pluvicto. \nUpdate Sept 1 2024: Since the last update I did three rounds of Pluvicto which was put on hold due to low blood counts. Had a total of 15 sessions of targeted radiation to reduce lesions in hips shoulders and  skull.\n\nNow PSA is climbing at about 2.2 month doubling time and is currently at 146. Have PSMA pet scan scheduled in a couple of weeks and will probably get back on Pluvicto.\n\nIn the mean time I had a fall and a \"pathological\" fracture to femur in two places. Recovery is going to be slow and I am trying to learn how to get around my house and shop and keep busy but getting really bored.",

It has gradually worsened over the years and I now have it my arms, hands, shoulders and sometimes head on awakening in the mornings. I am now on a Neupro patch 4mg plus a 1 mg Ropinerole. All due to augmentation. The only reason I am on this high dose is because I have terminal cancer with about 6 to 9 months left to live. My neurologist has advised my GP to prescribe Buprenorphine when the symptoms re-occur together with ondansetron for the nausea. I am extremely concerned about the future months in particular the end of my life, the last few weeks which I want to be peaceful without pain obviously, but also without my legs jumping about uncontrollably. I have been on the Health Unlocked forum for several years and have found it very helpful. I have been advised  about what treatment I should seek for the future months and have told my neurologist who took this on board and will hopefully follow it so that I don\u2019t suffer too much at the end.",

        "bio": "My father was diagnosed with Advanced Metastatic  Prostate Cancer in 2018. Had RP in 2019. Then Chemo. PSA started rising Dec 2021. Jan 2022 He was put on abiraterone with Prednisone, but PSA dropped for a year, then in 2023 started rising, so he was switched to Dex. PSA more than doubling every 3 months. He's now opted for another round of chemo. He could of had private Pluvicto, but his doctors did not think he was suited to this. Not sure why. He sadly refuses to let us go with him to doctors visits.\nMy mum has severe dementia.\nA best friend has COPD and Glaucoma.\nI had a brain tumour removed in Feb 2016 after suffering a Gran Mal and am thankful for every day I can get up and get out of bed.\n\nDec 2023. Dad's Abiraterone and Pred failing. Dad's PSA creeped up to 10. so told to stop taking them.\nDad referred for more chemo that did not stop the PSA rising\nJan 2024 consultants  referred him to recieve xofigo Radium 223 he was 90 Kilos\nMarch 12 My dad who was in decent health and still farming broke his tibia and fibular and became bedbound. The leg took longer to heal due to state of his bones from chemo and Abiraterone\nApril 7th Dad met with Radium 223 consultant. Consultant said they would have to postpone Radium until leg was 70% healed.\nMay leg still not healed.\nJune dad deteriorated  fast around june 20th could not keep food down, was in a lot of pain ( he has bone mets in ribs and pelvis.)\nJuly 3rd 2023 PSA shot up to 630. No more mention of Xofigo treatment aas dad has lost so much weight and he has been put on palliative care. He is currently now no meds for his MsPCa but is been given oral morphine for pain.",

        "bio": "Diagnosed early in May of 2021 with de novo Stage 4 PCa; metastasized diffusely over skeleton and skull with Gleason scores 9&10 in 10 of 12 cores taken from primary tumor. PSA 9.6\n\nImmediately received a Degarelix \u2018loading\u2019 ADT injection followed one month later by Eligard ADT; injections every 6 mos. now.\n\nBegan 6 (x 21-day) rounds of Docetaxal chemotherapy infusions early in July of 2021. Started on Zytiga and Prednisone soon after ending the Chemo infusions\u2026..and continuing on  with the Eligard, Zytiga and Prednisone at least until progression occurs.\n\nPSA has been undetectable since late in 2021; and in May of 2022 ALP returned back in normal range following a steady decline from the peak seen at time of Dx.\n\nBone pain, mostly pelvic, is almost entirely gone. Hot flashes continue to be troublesome, and fatigue has been very difficult to overcome. Some increased neuropathy, experienced during and just after chemotherapy, has subsided somewhat.\n\nFast forward to 07/2023, 1&1/2 years post last CT scan in 12/2021, and my orthopedic doctor is wanting a pelvic CT scan done to be certain the cancer hasn\u2019t spread further in hip area, where I\u2019ve probably developed pain from pushing my walking a bit too hard too quickly. Scan reveals marked healing/reduction of lesions and no new ones on bones in the pelvic area. Think it\u2019s safe to assume that\u2019s transferable to all the bone lesions across my skeleton and skull.\n\nMy last bone density scan in 06/2023 showed my mean bone mineral density continues to be near that for a young adult, without any bone support drugs! Beyond happy to have that at 70yo after 2 years on ADT (Eligard) and nearly as long on Abiraterone and Prednisone daily.\n\nMonitoring blood factors every 6 weeks, as I have elevated risk for liver problems, along with biannual bone density scans, and CT or PET scans as symptoms indicate they are advisable.\n\nPSA very gradually and steadily increasing beginning in Summer of 2023:\n\nJan 17, 2023=0\nMay 9, 2023=0.2\nAug 29, 2023=0.4\nDec 19, 2023=0.6\nStarted Provenge therapy in Dec. 2023\n\n\nPSMA/PET scan on 03/16/2023 provided the following info:\n\n1. Diffuse tracer activity within the prostate, and intensely tracer avid extensive metastatic osseous disease involving the axial and appendicular skeleton. The tracer uptake in the osseous lesions is more than that of the liver, with the majority of the lesions showing tracer uptake more than that of the parotid glands.\n\n2. No PET-CT evidence of non PSMA expressing metastatic disease.\n\nTheranostics RO at the local cancer center of excellence recommended I start Pluvicto therapy sooner rather than later, despite having no symptoms/pains.\n\nPSA on Apr. 10, 2024=0.8; MO advised discontinuing Zytiga + prednisone prior to starting Pluvicto therapy.\n\nFirst Pluvicto treatment in mid-April of 2024. Worst side effect in the early days following treatment was constant mild nausea accompanied by significant lower GI pain and other lower GI distresses which I\u2019d compare with having a rough course of antibiotics which wiped out most of my gut bacteria. After 10 days tied to see if regular ingestion of a high-quality yogurt might help and it seemed to work well.\n\nInitially fatigue from Pluvicto was no worse than while on ADT and  Zytiga + prednisone. As treatments progressed the fatigue has intensified, but other than that and some mildly elevated liver enzymes the side effects have been tolerable.\n\nWanting to keep informed on what has been working well for others in the later stages treatments realm for Advanced PCa..",

Eligard numbers are within target range but just slightly higher than the last reading on Degarelix - see PSA history above.\n\n01/2024\nThe switch to Eligard is not going good. In constant pain, recently non-stop abdominal pains that feel like really bad cramps. Going to propose switching back to Firmagon and hope this clears up the bone and abdominal pain that started in mid-december. Checked myself into Emergency to Dx abdominal pain. CT scan discovered cancer has progressed including new bone and liver mets.\n\n02/2024\nSwitched back to Firmagon.\nBad news - cancer has progressed to Small Cell Carcinoma of the Prostate.\nStopped taking Erleada 1 week before chemo scheduled to start.\nStarting chemo ASAP (carboplatin+etoposide).\nMO states this marks the progression to Castration Resistance.\nMost likely recent pain is related to emergence of SCCP and not Eligard, switching back anyway since I tolerate Firmagon better.\n\n03/2024\n2nd chemo cycled delayed 1 week due to low WBC/RBC counts (bone marrow suppression).\n2nd chemo cycle uses reduced dose based on reaction and recovery to 1st dose.",

Just thought I would share them here with you.\nDaily sunshine, exercise/walk, meds, talk therapy, a support system, spiritual life, a purpose, hobbies, journaling, time with friends and most of all self compassion. \nI hope this is of help to someone- keep on walking each day, if today is not good, that\u2019s ok, tomorrow is a brand new one, the slate is clean, and we start again.

This is usually eating crap, then not exercising which is my one good coping mechanism, and withdrawing from everyone.\nI am working on online school and luckily have mostly been able to hold down a job.\n\nUPDATE 2024: \nI am feeling great. I had a good therapist, did ketamine and ketamine assisted therapy, and read the book Feeling Great by David Burns. Now I don't tie my worth to any accomplishments or \"success\".

My cholesterol level has dropped to 3.2 from 8.6, which has also made my GP very happy. I've resumed exercising, now doing fast-paced walks of 10-15 km at a pace of 9 minutes per km, 4-5 times a week. \n\nAfter persistent heart diagnosis efforts, a cardiologist suspected atrial fibrillation (AF) and started me on Dronedarone (Multaq). Since then, my AF burden, measured via my Apple Watch Series 8, has been 2% or lower each week.\n\nMy GP is excellent and also diagnosed low vitamin D and I take 2 x 800 units per day and also I had low vitamin B12. After a series of 6 B12 shots it seems to be back up at the recommended level and we will review in 3 months.\n\nAfter some side effects with the amlodipine of ankle swelling and muscle aches I find that taking 100mg of CoQ10 every day has really helped.",

I have eight hospital admissions with chest pain via ambulance .We have a big family history of stents and a bypasses Which was only found to be needed after angiogram. . So I asked for angiogram over 2 years ago which was rejected.  The pain I got so bad I couldn't get up the stairs, have a shower or walk more than five steps without collapsing with chest pain.  I was told it was reflux and there was nothing wrong with me. \nI booked in with the spire for a private angiogram which was done a week later.  I expected a stent with my symptoms and was absolutely floored when I was told I needed a trip or her bypass.  A week later while I was waiting for an op date, I had a big heart attack and was admitted for my bypass.  I then learnt on my previous eight admissions my blood's indicated  heart attack and I was sent home and nobody can understand why.\nI am now 13 weeks post triple bypass.  I can honestly say it has been the worst experience of my Life.  The first 6 weeks were the absolute worst and I thought I was getting a little bit better but now the pain in my sternum just will not go away.  I'm not sure how I should be healing.",

So have a good idea of what is going on in my mind and body.  After years of struggle the penny dropped.  The only person that could help me was myself, So I got every self help program and book I could.  Slowly things began to change, for the better.  And this is still going on.  I look for new ideas and words of wisdom every day.  The biggest help in my life came from a man called Dr wayne Dyer.  You can see him on you tube.  I came across Health unblocked just to get some info about insurance.  But  when i read the posts i though I may be able to help someone.  Instead of just myself.  I often thought why I still keep learning more, When i have found enough to last me several life times.  Now I know it is to pass it on to people that need to know it the most.  When they are in very difficult times.  So I decided to try and help people on Healthunlocked  by sharing my journey in life. And to be of service to others, This is now my purpose in life.  Lots of love from Ray.  I would just like to make it very clear  ,  I have no Medical qualifications .  And my comments will be purely on how to cope mentally .  They will be mainly on how to control your thinking process .  This is what i had to do over 46 years to survive,  While coping with Clinical Depression and Anxiety .  Dont believe every thing i say i am in this with you all, and still learning.  So from the age of 17 i did not have a clue who to turn to or what to do,  Suicide was probably the main thought i had, fortunately i did,nt  go down that route . so many young  people do. So if i can stop this happening to just 1 person it will be time well spent on this forum.  The only thing i can do is use my experiences to help them.  Im no expert so dont take my advice as medically  correct, its just how i see it.  Always seek medical help first.  And what ever i say may not be correct for you.  But it has worked for me over 46 years and counting.  Use your own mind check it out first. Because if i told you to jump in a puddle would you no!  You make your own mind up and say no. Your humble servant ray.  Never stop trying, you can believe that.!!!",

It was during this challenging time that I made the decision to consult a psychiatrist and receive a diagnosis for ADHD.\n\nThroughout my life, I have always sensed that I was different, but my parents did not explore this matter further due to the stigma surrounding ADHD in the 1970s and 1980s. In fact, my high school guidance counselor advised my family and me that attending college would be a waste of money, as I was unlikely to graduate. Contrary to that prediction, I successfully completed a Bachelor of Science degree and subsequently earned a Master of Library and Information Science.\n\nSince my diagnosis, I have dedicated significant time to researching ADHD to better understand myself. I have engaged with numerous books, articles, and videos on the subject. While I continue to face challenges in my daily life, I am much better equipped to manage them now, thanks to my diagnosis, medication, and bi-weekly therapy sessions.\n\nI am eager to share my experiences and learn from others.

I had the classic symptoms of pain in my shoulders and then my hips which developed quickly in just over three weeks until I could barely dress myself.  I had chest and hip X-rays which were normal and blood tests which revealed an ESR of 44.  My Gp immediately put me on a dose of 15mg of Prednisolone.  After about 4 days I felt much better but had difficulty sleeping as I was told to take the Pred at night.   I changed this to a breakfast dose and my sleep improved.   My first Pred reduction was after 3 weeks to 12.5 mg.  Looking back I definitely had a flare on this dose but was told to persevere by the Rheumatology consultant.   After another three weeks I was told to reduce to 10mg.  Again another flare and back up to 12.5.  This has been the way my Pred journey has been.  I quickly realized from the posts on health unlocked that slow and steady is the way to go.  I struggled badly to get below 10mg of Pred but using the DSNS method I made it to 8.5 mg.  My Rheumatologist is insisting I reduce now by .5 mg per month.  I\u2019ve tried twice to get down to 8 but the pain returns.  I am currently on 8mg but experiencing the worst pain since diagnosed in August 2020.  The consultant now wants me to take Methotrexate.  I am really against taking this drug yet.  I have type 2 diabetes and I\u2019m currently on 9 prescription medications including Risedronate which the consultant insists I take and won\u2019t refer me for a Dexascan.  I\u2019m currently in a bad place with this illness and will write a post to hopefully get some advice.  I have read posts every day since Joining the forum in October 2020 and this site has been invaluable to me.",

Just after Christmas 2015 I had emergency surgery to remove a bowel blockage. I had further back surgery in September 2020 for 2 prolapsed discs, to release inflamed nerves & scar tissue from previous surgery. Since then I have had severe fatigue, cannot do any cooking or housework & cannot exercise without being completely exhausted. I\u2019m now a wheelchair user. I was finally diagnosed with ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in November 2021. I was diagnosed with Functional Neurological Disorder in October 2022. I have attended 4 different Pain Clinics but have come to the conclusion that breathing exercises are not the cure I\u2019m looking for. I am at the point of thinking there is someone sticking pins in an effigy of me! We have 13 year old identical triplet grandsons. I am now medically retired and live with my wonderful husband and Greek Harehound, rescue dog from Cyprus (Ada).

I also have osteoporosis, empty sella syndrome (my pituitary gland is damaged or even missing). I have found out recently that I was diagnosed  with spastic diplegia (cerebral palsy) in 1985 but wasn't told about this until a couple of years ago. Because of my multiple health problems I have to use a wheelchair to get around. I also suffer from sinusitis and have chronic lymphedema and am prone to cellulitis. I have an injury on my left foot; I spilt a pan of boiling water on it, needless to say it is very painful most of the time and is still healing after two and a half years. My toes were amputated in February 2023 and this is now the wound which is still healing. I don't know how long this will take but I just have to deal with it! I am normally very positive and very out going and love to chat to people but the injury is making me feel very down which is not surprising! \n\nI have been going through a very bad patch the last few years, having lost several family members and close friends including my Father, uncle and brother-in-law. I recently got back in touch with other family members and it has made a big difference to me in a lot of ways. I have had a big fall out in the family but still have contact with my niece which is going very well, we get on ok but we both have multiple health problems so kind of understand one another. \n\nI live in supported living in Devon, I love having my independence, It is very important to try and do as much for myself while I can! I have my own flat, carers do as much for me as I need them to but prefer to do things for myself if I can. I think it is important for us all to try and do as much for ourselves whilst we can, it is too easy to get in to a situation and have to rely on other people but it is better to stay independent for as long as you can. It really helps with your mental health and confidence, life is hard enough as it is! \n\nI am totally blind although do see light and dark, my eyes work the brain doesn't. I have noticed recently that my sight has worsened, I have cataract and dry eye, very bright light really hurts me. Having so many health problems it is hard to cope at times but you have to do your best. Some things are much harder to handle and currently the burn and nerve pain are really getting to me especially after a dressing change! I am noticing more bright lights at night time, I believe now that these are focal seizures but need to find out more about them.\n\nAs you can see, even though I am dealing with so much, I try hard to stay cheerful and keep myself going, it'll be too easy to let go and give in but I won't!",

GP sent me for a scan and I was then referred to an endocrinologist, who explained I had hypothyroidism but due to baby brain I didn\u2019t take much in at the time! I was started on 50mg levothyroxine, which was increased to alternating 75mg/50mg each day. \nOver the past few years I have experienced worsening intestinal issues - bloating, cramps, tummy ache etc. GP tested for coeliac (my mum had it) and came back negative. At my wits end, I tried the Happy Gut diet (vegan, gluten free and low FODMAP) and had immediate improvements, but after a few weeks my hair started falling out and I couldn\u2019t sleep. Got blood test and iron was extremely low. GP also did stool test which detected blood in stools. Had OGD and colonoscopy, had biopsies taken for coeliac (negative), but I was gluten free at the time. Couldn\u2019t understand what was going on, or which way to turn. \n\nIt was not until I started to research into my own health that I even suspected my thyroid issue was causing vitamin deficiencies and also the stomach problems!  Coming onto this forum was a revelation as I was told I had an autoimmune condition (Hashimoto\u2019s). This all made sense, as when I went back on gluten again I experienced joint stiffness and couldn\u2019t work out why, but clearly there was an inflammatory response. I take Floradix daily which helps with my iron level and vitamin D spray. \nI am still on my journey to recovery. I definitely don\u2019t have the energy I feel I should, and particularly struggle around the time of my period. Have cut out gluten and dairy and gut problems and mostly gone.\nAfter thyroid tests in March 2023 showed my TSH was 2.8, I had an fight with my GP to increase my Levothyroxine dose to 75 daily - only a few days on this increased dose and the veil of brain fog has lifted and energy levels much improved. Things dipped when I caught Covid at the end of May and now in September, I am struggling with fatigue and brain fog again. Just got Medichecks results and planning to tackle GP again re Levo increase\u2026",

I'm wondering if the weakness is a neurological issue. I e had a Laminectomy in my low back but received no relief from that.  The doctor thought that may help with the weak legs. I have no idea how to proceed or where to continue to look for help. Nerve conduction testing is pretty normal. Now when trying to sleep on my side I have burning in one hip and have to stay off of that side. I'm a 52 yr old female. Is anyone else experiencing similar issues?",

GP suggested antidepressants, and statins for cholesterol......I decided not to take them as I felt my thyroid condition might be a cause of some of this. \n\nIn January of 2024 my symptoms became so bad that I couldn't get out of bed. Completely exhausted, depressed, and filled with anxiety. \n\nI went to see a thyroid specialist who tested T3 levels and cortisol with 4 point saliva test. I have phase 1 HPA axis dysfunction, T3 at very bottom of range, and low vitamin levels. \n\nI have recently started supplements for adrenal support and T3 hormone has been added in addition to the existing T4 I have been taking. This week (29 July) I will start vitamin supplementation.\n\nI have started to feel a little bit better, but still feels like a way to go. \n\nThis community has been my main source of guidance and information. I am so grateful to everyone who has been so kind and helpful to me. \n\nThank you, \nLuke",

        "bio": "Portland OCD\n \nOCD\nI'm a 73yo retired physician who's struggled with OCD most of my life. While initially tic like as a child, it has evolved into obsessive thoughts (like trying to figure out what time it would be if I interchanged the hands of a clock, constantly calculating exchange rates for money when I travelled overseas, figuring age differences between myself and someone else, to the month, etc), perfectionism (like cleaning shelves and countertops over and over until it felt right, screwing in a lightbulb until it felt right, often resulting in breaking it, etc.) But more recently small physical actions (like blinking 10 times in a row until it felt even, swallowing in a certain way until it felt right, often leading to drinking many glasses of water which I'd have to diurese the rest of the day, etc.)These are but a few if the myriad of symptoms that I get. It's like my mind sticks to things to keep it occupied. It's like there's a little dictator in my head that tells me what I need to do, and decides whether or not I did it right. \nIt has waxed and waned throughout my adulthood, but I've managed to have a successful career and social life. But it sabotages enjoyment and peace of mind. There seems to be no definite triggering obsession other than the stress of aging and retirement, but over the last few months it seems to be getting worse. \nI had traditional therapy as a teenager, before OCD was considered a neuro disorder rather than from dysfunctional past experiences.\nI've had OCD targeted therapy including groups from the Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, OR, which kind of helped for a while. As far as meds, once I conceded that I needed them, Paxil worked for a while, but had a side effect profile. Lexapro, although promising at first, doesn't seem to help much now. \nI've managed to have a successful career and social life. I'm married and have a 24 yo daughter.\nSo I'm open to suggestions, and considering starting more focused treatment. Not sure about how ERP would work as my symptoms change continually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSent from my iPhone",

        "bio": "I have been on an endless painful journey for sooooo long. Prior to 2017 I would suffer with heavy bleeding and painful periods that would last weeks. This was treated with a Mirena which was a blessing until we decided to extend our family further. We unfortunately lost our 6th unborn child, which devastated us that much we decided to not try again. \n\n\nI had the Mirena reapplied and following 2 attempts it would be displaced, on exploration they discovered fibroids. Treatment was started and I insisted on a hysterectomy which the Gynae team refused and met me half way with having my tubes removed. Following further treatment with a medication an alert was issued on the medication that all patients had to undergo scans of their liver, on receiving this it was discovered I had liver disease. \n\n\nIn 2019 I was in constant severe pain which resulted in me being bed bound most the month especially around my period. No treatment was working and I had an significant impact in mobility, which has led to me having to use a walking stick now. I was unable to go to work or even care for my children. \n\n\nAfter endless attempts and disappointments, the hospital agreed the hysterectomy, the day before surgery they cancelled it due to my Diabetes. I put in a big complaint over their lack of preparation in ensuring a care plan was created and they failed to discuss with the Diabetes team if they were happy for surgery to go ahead and what the care plan should entail (who were in support of the surgery). I lost all faith with the medical team and asked my GP to refer me to another hospital and to the one I chose. I said I was prepared to start afresh as this team was a better one than the one I was under. Whilst waiting for my first appointment my GP diagnosed me as having Endometriosis as they were confident this was the problem. Following this the Pain clinic finally after 2 years agreed to see me and I have been under them since. \n\n\nOn my first appointment to the new hospital in 2020 I was advised had I approached them first they would have granted my request of a hysterectomy and not put me through all I went through. This left me angry and upset that I had spent years with a hospital that does not follow the same process. Surgery was planned with a careful planned care plan. The surgery entailed 2 outcomes the hysterectomy and exploring for Endometriosis. Due to complications in surgery they were unable to achieve the second part, had they done this they could have removed my ovaries when seeing them having cysts and Endometriosis on them. \nShortly after surgery I was suffering sever back pain and had a MRI which they diagnosed me with a herniated lower disc which they feel was caused from the emergency in surgery. \n\n\nIt has took 4 years of loads of scans for them to now diagnose me with Endometriosis on my ovaries and Poly Cystic Ovaries, with the view that Endometriosis is elsewhere too which explains how severe my pain levels are. Surgery is unfortunately at present not an option due to how high risk I am and I was unable to tolerate HRT treatment as it made my Diabetes worse. The plan now is long term pain management.  Regular pain medication now includes: Paracetamol, Codeine, Amitriptyline, and Pregabalin. When my pain levels increase I take Morphine, Ibuprofen pain patches, TENs therapy and Heat therapy . With pain patches being introduced at present to aid in coming off Codeine and Morphine. \n\n\nDespite all this medication my pain levels continue to be on a good day 5/10 and on a bad day 10/10 where I need to take the morphine. I have to carry a pack with pain medication and therapy when I leave the home alongside one for my Diabetes. In an attempt to aid with weight loss and due to being restricted on exercise I was put on Ozempic/Trulicity which initially worked, but it is constantly battling my Gynae problems and I always end up with my weight just stalling rather then increasing or decreasing. \n\n\nThis journey has been one long, depressing, disappointing, and painful, where my quality of life, mobility, and gaining further health problems has impacted on me greatly.  On receiving the diagnosis I thought I would be overjoyed but it left me with such sadness that there is no process that makes this quicker, less evasive, and humane, especially for many other women that undergo this. \n\n\nWhilst my story may seem depressing, I see it as a opportunity to aid others to know that you are not alone. Whilst my mobility is still impacted upon and I can only stand and walk for up to 10 minutes, I am grateful I am able to not be bed bound anymore, I continue to work with physio which is a long term process and have started slowly going swimming. The pain clinic continue to review me and I am on the waiting list for acupuncture. I have found work where I can pick my own hours, days and capacity, to gain my independence and help my emotional wellbeing. \n\n\nWith technology advancing it is odd that this process does not receive the necessary funding to make this process easier for women. There are consultants trained in this speciality and yet they too take too long to make a decision. Each hospital has a different approach rather then follow one approach so there is continuity and women are not having to research into a hospital in the hope they have a better outcome. By continuing to share our stories hopefully these areas become past hurdles, with many avenues of focused treatment plans.",

        "bio": "I was diagnosed with 11q del, unmutated CLL in 2013 at age 56 in UK when I was working as a NHS Healthcare Scientist in the role of Haematology Services Manager.   This included responsibility for the  Haematology laboratories and Haem-Onc clinical trials including those for CLL.  This background has given me a thorough understanding of all aspects of CLL and other haematological disorders including diagnostics, imaging and treatments.  \n I continue to keep myself up to date with Haematology and CLL in particular by reading and attending conferences.   I have been a patient advocate for several years, working with various charities but particularly CLL Support, the only CLL specific UK charity.  \nThrough these charities, I work with CLL doctors, NICE and other regulatory bodies trying to influence treatment and information availability with the aim of making a positive impact on the health and lives of CLL patients.  My presence here is another aspect of that work.\nPersonally,  I had 2 years of reasonable health which I used to try to improve my general fitness.  As FCR was the only option in the UK in 2015,  I opted to take part in the FLAIR study and started treatment on Ibrutinib + Rituximab in October 2015.   My treatment stopped in October 2021 and I planned to enter the STATIC trial as soon as it was open.\nIn terms of side effects, I developed intermittent joint arthralgia which was very debilitating, weight gain, heartburn and severe hypertension  of 228/74 which resulted in an emergency overnight admission to hospital.   The side effects have diminished overtime and my hypertension is now well controlled on Losartan.   In 2021 I was still MRD positive but in clinical CR after nearly 6 years of ongoing Ibrutinib treatment.  In 6 months of 2021, between Feb and October,  I intentionally lost 105 pounds in weight through a low carbohydrate and high fat diet and felt amazing.\nIn October 2021 my 6 years of Ibrutinib treatment stopped as per the trial protocol and within days I had tennis ball sized nodes under my arms.  My consultant was understandably concerned that I had developed Richter's and there followed several months of investigations including CT, PET (reported as Richter's), biopsies and finally a node removal.  Throughout I felt mostly  well which indicated more of a post Ibrutinib flare and relapse rather than Richter's and the LN histology showed no Richter's, but an accelerated and very active CLL.  Unlike my pretreatment disease where my lymph count was 400+ this time my disease was all nodal and my lymph count never rose above 6.\nI was started on Acalabrutinib and had very little response, it held my disease and my lymph count didn't rise but my LNs didn't reduce.  I opted to try a new, first in human trial, of a BiTE - a bispecific T cell engaging antibody in London.  See here for details.\nhttps://healthunlocked.com/cllsupport/posts/147603669/time-to-take-a-bite-bispecific-t-cell-engagers-bites\nhttps://healthunlocked.com/cllsupport/posts/private/147616512/time-for-a-change-of-direction-for-me\nUnfortunately my nodes were growing faster than the treatment could work and my liver enzymes showed that my liver was struggling which was going to make increasing the dose impossible.\nI returned to my local consultant and we decided that it was very urgent that I get treated with Venetoclax and Rituximab.  I spent the first two seeks as an in patient because of tumour lysis and I found it very hard to be confined to the ward.  The third week I managed to negotiate as an out patient, visiting my local hospital every day for monitoring. During this third week, now on 100mg of V, I was happy to see that my nodes had started to soften and reduce.  Thankfully the last few ramp ups were all uneventful and I  started the Rituximab on time.  \nAfter 6 months I had a CT and BMB to assess my level of disease.  I still had enlarged nodes and approx 1% CLL cells which was disappointing but, as my consultant said, I had a massive amount of disease. My consultant decided to do some preliminary investigations in case I needed a stem cell transplant so blood was taken for tissue typing and a search of the donor register was undertaken.  I was surprised and upset at this possibility.\nIn February/March 2023 after almost 12 months of Venetoclax I had a repeat CT and BMB to assess my response again - so called MRD directed therapy.  I still had slightly enlarged nodes and approx 1 n 10,000 cells was a CLL cell.  My Dr rang saying he was pleased with the response and now was the time to do the transplant as I had three 12/12 donors, the best that they could be.   He also said that  if I was still reluctant then he wouldn't pressurise me.  \nI said that I would think carefully,  knowing that if I were to have one, it would not be successful if I waited for my CLL to start to relapse.  Also, given my age, any older would also increase the risks of my dying as a result of the procedure.   \nAfter I week, I sent him an email saying I wanted to go ahead with the stem cell transplant and thanking him for being so proactive in looking after me.  The transplant team rang a week later saying that he had chosen the 25 year old male as my  donor and they would now be in touch with him.  My transplant was originally scheduled for May 2023 but I asked for it to be June and the date is coincidentally, precisely 10 years since my diagnosis.   I'm very grateful to my donor and the haematology team for this chance of long term remission.\nI went into hospital on 19th June 2023 and had 6 days of intensive chemo followed by my new German stem cells on day 7.  That is officially known as Day 0 and all the days following are Day + n.  The first few weeks post transplant were stormy, complicated by infection, vomiting, tremor and severe mouth ulceration needing morphine.  A change of cyclosporin to tacrolimus had a really positive effect and drastically reduced the vomiting and tremor, my real recovery started at that point. \nBy day+ 82, I was feeling so much stronger but easily tired.  The important thing is that my new marrow is working fantastically well and a post transplant CT scan shows that my enlarged lymph nodes are gone.  Just a BMT biopsy in early October 2023 to check how much of the marrow is donor.  If it's more than 95% that will be the best predictor of a long term remission/cure.  \nNow Day +183 and my bone marrow results from October only showed 73% donor T cells - not good enough.  However all immunosuppression was stopped and a repeat in March 24 will determine the next course of action.  My Hb is stubbornly low at 80g/l and I often have  tachycardia and shortness of breath which prevents me from doing everything that I want to do.  The anaemia is thought to be multifactorial - ABO mismatched donor, folic acid deficiency (result of months of poor eating) and less than optimal kidney function (from the transplant process).   I just feel like I get tired so easily, otherwise I am very well.\nDay +350 showed even less donor T cells at 43% and continued anaemia so EPO injections prescribed and a course of donor lymphocyte infusions to try to increase the donor T cells to the required 95%.  This may induce some GVHD so I've a list of things to be aware of.\nA slight uptick in my lymph count and uncertainty about whether I needed more donor T cells meant a bone marrow was needed and I had that in early November 24.  After a few weeks wait the results came back - 99% donor marrow and T cells.  I am officially in remission with the prospect of it being long lasting at last.  Just my fitness to tackle now :)",

Since PM implanted I have infrequent episodes, few symptoms and feel generally much, much better.  I take no heart meds other than anti-coagulant.\n\nDeveloped sudden onset symptoms of Myasthenia gravis June 2014, treated with Mycophenolate., Pyridostigamine to control symptoms. Took about 3 years to get Mg under control.  Now still have the odd flare, especially if I have an infection, but generally well and starting to titrate down Mycophenolate.\n\nI am interested in holistic thinking and therapies and the link between perception, mental health and body functioning.",

Much of it in last 3 years and given so many prescribed meds they made me feel worse! So I took my healthcare into my own hands!  You may be surprised at the results,. I don't follow all the communities, just ones that on occasion have had something in common over time, with conditions, procedures and prescribed meds and tests I've undergone here in France. I'm still waiting for any definitive  answers so decided to start medically researching for myself. I thoroughly recommend the following, drugs.com - check out whether the various meds you take for various conditions are compatible or not! \n- check out what your blood test results mean! Labtestsonline\n- are your different medications compatible with each other? - drugs.com\nWikipedia - great for information on various conditions! Just put the condition or symptom in your search bar and wiki will be amongst the top ones.\nMayo clinic - NIH - both American sites but very good info.\n\nI will not engage in anything involving Cancer though - I have been tested for it and alcohol, in several tests to see if related, and I don't have it  - the specialists have treatment for that well covered. \nAlso, it is a distressing disease/treatment regime for those who do, I was a volunteer helper here in France for an Expat Charity that helps residents and their families here, with information, assistance, translation, hospital visits, fundraising etc. I moved away to a different area  and there is no Branch near, or I would be helping out again. I ha e not been without my own health and living condition problems, since marriage breakup. no matter, we are all here on health Unlocked  to listen to and help each other, as, when and where we can. \n\nI think of the 3/4 Communities I go to regularly, the Moderators/ Administrators are fantastic, the hours of their days they give up to monitor and respond on their respective communities, along with us mere mortals who are not medical specialists or doctors, but just trying to help other as best we can :-) \n\nLast but not least - Don't forget, we are ALL individuals, even though we may have the same illness/ condition title, information you find must be used at your own discretion, in the context of being relevant to you - if in doubt Go and See your own Doctor! Wishing you all Health, happiness and  of course, a solution to your queries! \nPS, as if you hadn't guessed, yes I am Half English and Scottish, not so easy learning French now ! \n\nI enjoy, computing, reading, politics,pot plant gardening  I've semi adopted  twice,  abandoned cats -  Ist was black and currently it's a Tabby - both been deflea'd and wormed, fed and loved, but not allowed inside, don't know if I may have to move again! \n,",

My boyfriend is very understanding, but we're a right pair, as he has FAP (a condition causing lots of colon polyps and a predisposition to bowel cancer if the colon is not removed, which his has been), and is awaiting a rectal excision in October.  We wouldn't make a healthy body between us, but we're still happy, which is what counts.\r \n \r \n\r \n \r \nAt the last rheumy appointment, I was tentatively diagnosed with fibromyalgia, but he did note some joint swelling in my right hand, so I'm waiting on the bloods to come back so I know what I'm fighting.

        "bio": "Prostate cancer Gleason 8 Stage 4 T3-N2-M1. Not sure I properly understand the metastasis situation. Nothing in the bones or visible on the CT scans but considered low volume metastatic because there appears to be some microscopic ones in a lymph node in my abdomen or something like that.\n\nNovember 2019 my first ever PSA was 79 just because I turned 51. Had no symptom whatsoever. Weighted 210 lbs at the time. \nAnother test a couple weeks later my PSA was 80.\nHad a biopsy performed in January of 2020 and was diagnosed Gleason 8 (4+4) with all cores positive.\nHad a CT Scan and Bone scan in either Dec 2019 or Jan 2020, none showing anything alarming.\nJanuary 2020 became keto pescatarian and joined a gym.\nHad a T3-MRI in March of 2020. PSA was 108 (might be because of biopsy from January).\nMarch 2020 did a 18-day water fast which ended in April. My PSA in April was of 116 (which I think might have been due to the fast). Weight was down to 190 before the fast and was 170 after my fast.\nHad a Pet Scan in April of 2020 which showed some very tiny metastasis outside of the envelope that would be too small to show up on the previous scans. Told they are in abdomen and pelvic region. Nothing on bones, lungs or otherwise. \nApril 18 2002 Got a Lupron injection and accepted to get radiation by end of summer.\nApril 20 2020 My PSA was down to 78. Doctor says Lupron would not act this fast so it is probably a mix of what I am doing and Lupron. (I now believe that it is what the doctor says but also that my previous 116 was higher than it would have otherwise been to begin with because of the biopsy and of the long fast since I've later noticed that my PSA always rises after a water fast for whatever reason).\nMay 04 2020. PSA down to 20.74 \nMay 21 2020. PSA down to 1.95\nJune 9 2020. PSA is 2.48. Weight is 165lbs and it appears to be my new normal weight going forward. \nJune 18 2020. PSA is 2.67\nJuly 27 2020. PSA is 2.49. Refused to get another Lupron shot scheduled for August because I had felt horrible on Lupron, could barely hold on to my job with the clouded mind and lack of energy. Also refused to get radiation for fear of getting new cancers or of getting burns that will never heal.\nAugust 17 2020. PSA is 3.17. Feeling better than I have in at least the past 15 years. Weight typically fluctuates between 160 and 165 which is is less than I used to weight even when I was 18 years old (I was 180 at 18).\nSeptember 8 2020. PSA is 4.26 Getting worried about the ever rising PSA so my oncologist says that we could try just doing ADT without radiation as some do for life. Since I had a horrible time on Lupron, the doctor wants me to try Casodex 150mg/day.\nSeptember 18. PSA rose anyway despite the Casodex 150mg.\nSeptember 20. Started the SQ1 program which is basically whole food plant based (WFPB) with lots of green and carrot juice. Stopped Casodex because I could not work due to it making depressed and so tired. Realized later on that in just 10ish days, Casodex had made me lose 5lbs and my weight was down to 160.\nSeptember 29 2020. Started a 7-day water fast to try to protect me from radiations from the Bone scan and CT scans that took place on Oct 2 and 6 respectively. Both scans are negatives just like they had been at the beginning of 2020. \nOctober 20 2020. PSA is 27 which I now believe was due to the water fast but did not know at the time so this got me scared into giving Casodex another shot but with 50mg/day rather than 150mg. 50mg was much more tolerable and I was able to work.\nOctober 23 2020. Began doing Casodex 50mg and began doing RSO (Cannabis oil) and Artemisinin. \nNovember 12 2020. PSA down to 19.76 which looked promising.\nDecember 1 2020. PSA is up to 25.\nDecember 2 2020. Upped my Casodex dosage to 100mg. Feeling a little worse from it but am managing to work if I take some coffee and if I take some Concerta/Ritalin for concentration. Failed to notice at the time that this new dose of Casodex 100mg was making me lose weight and did not link the occasional shortness of breath to it at the time.\nDecember 10 2020. Feeling like crap, I started a water-fast hoping to clean up my system and feel better. Went from 157 to 148 which is kind of normal during the fast but I hadn't realized the Casodex was messing up my weight as well so I was not regaining any even after the fast was over I kept losing weight. \nDecember 15 2020. PSA is up to 31.97. That is when I began to make a connection between fasting and PSA.\nDecember 16 2020. Upped my Casodex dose to 150mg. \nDecember 22 2020. Stopped taking Casodex completely as I felt just about ready to die. Had been sleeping 16+ hours a day and spent the hours awake to simply cry and stressed that I'll lose my job, house, everything and leaving my wife homeless from dying so rapidly.\nDecember 25 2020. Weight is down to 146, I am not getting better at all despite having stopped the Casodex. However I am no longer artificially depressed from the Casodex but I am so out of breath that even making juice is an effort that leaves me panting. \nDecember 27 2020. Went to the emergency room of the hospital where they confirmed that my issues are not Covid related and that all of my problems are indeed side-effects of Casodex (confusion, word switching, forgetful ness, weight changes, depression, weakness, etc...). All blood work looks good and the X-Rays of my lungs looks as healthy as those I had taken in 2014. So I just need to wait for 4-6 weeks in order for Casodex to be fully out of my system.\n\nJanuary 2021 started Lupron again. \nApril 2021 started Abiraterone\nMay 2021 began radiotherapy in what the doc hopes might be a possible cure based on the stampede study. Getting 38 treatments (87 Gray) to my prostate and lower abdomen/pelvic region which should end on July 13 2021.\n\nMarch 2022: Began suffering from peripheral neuropathy in my feet. \nMay 2022: Followed Nalakrats suggestion of Benfothiamine (B1), R-Lipoic Acide and NAC. The neuropathy is now under control. \n\nDecember 02 2022: Received my last Lupron injection\n\nApril 25 2023: I have started to get swollen feet everyday from the afternoon until the following morning. Not sure whether this too is neuropathy from radiation or some pre-diabetes from prednisone\n\n***\nMay 02 2023: Stopped taking Zytiga and began tapering off from prednisone. My treatment has reached its end for now. The waiting game now begins as to whether or not my testosterone will be coming back and once it is back, then waiting to see if the PSA remains at 0.01 or starts to climb.\n\nJune 14 2023: I am now completely off Prednisone. The withdrawals were painful so I had to adjust the protocol to taper off more slowly than the pace that my oncologist had recommended. \n\nJuly 3 2023: Have begun the keto diet once more and did a 4 day fast (1 dry, 3 water only). That appears to have helped a lot with the swelling of my feet. It should also help me lose the 50lbs or so that I've gained since I began the hormonal treatment 2.5 years ago.\n\nAug 18 2023: PSA is 0.09, Testosterone is 3.3 nmol/l (95.2 ng/dL), Testosterone FREE is 52 pmol/l, Testosterone BIO is 1.26 nmol/l\n\nOct 6 2023: PSA is 0.14 (55.56% increase from previous result), Testosterone is 11.3 nmol/l (326.0 ng/dL), Testosterone FREE is 138 pmol/l, Testosterone BIO is 3.49 nmol/l\n\nDec 5 2023: PSA is 0.22 (57.14% increase from previous result), Testosterone is 10 nmol/l (288.5 ng/dL), Testosterone FREE is 129 pmol/l, Testosterone BIO is 3.34 nmol/l\n\nFeb 6 2023: PSA is 0.39  (77.27% increase from previous result), Testosterone is 9.6 nmol/l (277.0 ng/dL), Testosterone FREE is 141 pmol/l, Testosterone BIO is 3.65 nmol/l\n\nThen on Feb 16, I began taking Ivermectin 12mg once a day, 4 days on, 3 days off.\n\nApr 16 2024: PSA is 0.90 (130.77% increase from previous result), Testosterone is 10.2 nmol/l (294 ng/dL), Testosterone FREE is 110 pmol/l, Testosterone BIO is 2.85 nmol/l\n\nThen on April 24, I began taking HydroxyChloroquine 200mg 2 times a day.\n\nPSA 2024-05-15 : 1.07 (18.89% * from previous result).  Testosterone: 294\n\nNote that this latest test was only 30 days later, not 60. Still, even if I double it to 37% to mimic the regular span between my test, the growth has been slowed dramatically where it had been in a ever increasing upward trend before that. Sadly I will probably have to cut my experiment short because a bone scan made earlier this month shows one met to the right shoulder blade. That metastasis is probably what was making my PSA rise so quickly before I began taking Ivermecting + HydroxyChloroquine. \n\nBecause of the shoulder blade metastasis, my oncologist wants me on the Orgovix and Xtandi combo and to get radiation to my shoulder blade. I've agreed to try out the drug combo but asked to postpone the radiation as I fear its risk of causing a pulmonary fibrosis and I've never had great lungs (got on and off asthma and bronchitis 2-3 times a year) so I don't want to have more issues breathing. \n\nI will have another PSA test around June 5 to assess the impact of having taken Ivermectin and HCQ a little longer but after that, even though I have a prescription for both drugs already, I will likely just take Orgovix by itself for a few weeks to assess its side-effects and only then add the Xtandi so that I can see if it adds more SEs or not to what Orgovix does. \n\nPSA 2024-06-05 : 1.67 (56.07% * from previous result).  It appears that the benefit from IVM or HCQ was short-lived since the rise continued. Testosterone: 398\n\nBegan Orgovyx/Relugolix 120mg on 2024-06-07\n\nPSA 2024-06-26: 0.06 Testosterone: 28.9\n\nAdded Enzalutamide/Xtandi 160mg on 2024-06-27\n\nReceived radiation to right shoulder blade. 27 G over 3 sessions of 9G each on 2024-06-28, 2024-07-02 and 2024-07-04\n\n PSA 2024-08-06: 0.30  Testosterone: 28.9\n PSA 2024-10-15: 0.50  Testosterone: 34.6\n PSA 2024-11-27: 0.55  Testosterone: 40.38\n PSA 2025-01-08 :0.74  Testosterone: 49.03",

        "bio": "Diagnosed with prostate cancer with Gleason   scale of 8.  I have had consults with my urologist, endocrinologist, radiologist, and the surgeon. The surgeon was the last consult, i am being steered toward radiation,  proton radiation. The surgeon was going to do robotic surgery to remove the prostate but due to  a surgery for small intestine bowl resection( removed around 12 inches). He was concerned about scare tissue from that and hernia surgery/mesh in my abdomen. He was very familiar with the radiation facility and was impressed  with them. He said he had another patient with Gleason 9 he was thinking about steering to the radiation facility.  I have started the hormone therapy two days ago( pills at this time). Waiting on Monday to call radiation facility and have them set up putting in the markers and hydrogel. I also need to get PS MA and MRI. Also was instructed to start eating vegan or close as i can get. Update: I did PSMA scan and caner has moved outside prostate to right lymph  node. Doc. Said Stage 4A. \nToday , Au g14th i got markers install in prostate  and hydrogel. Getting closer to proton therapy. I have an MRI scheduled soon. Started the lupron shots on Aug. 22nd and had lab work done. PSA showed a drop to 1.44 from 4.25. Not sure what this means but sounds good to me. Up date as of Sept. 26th. ..as of today i am on my 8th radiation treatment. I see rad. Doctor every Wednesday. I saw him on Sept. 18th and ask when they were doing more scans or blood work? He said about 3 months after radiation treatment , which would put it into Nov. time frame. I made an appointment with my regular doctor to get flu shot and blood lab work done. The results were very high liver enzymes, AST 136, ALT 306, but my PSA was 0.13\nThe drugs i am taking are Lupron shot(once every 3 months), Abiraterone 1000mg, prednisone 5 mg, tadalafil 5 mg. The Abiraterone can cause liver damage and i think that is what is got my liver enzymes elevated to 300. I stopped taking it and the prednisone a couple of days ago until i can see the doctor Friday. It aggravates me that i had to go out on my own to have my blood labs run but i am glad i did. I have to be honest and say i have been self medicating with Fenbendazole, 1 gram a day, started Aug 1st. I do not think that is what is pushing liver enzymes up due to the dates taken and test dates, but i am giving it a break as well. More to come.  Up date Oct 29th. Had a 5 day stay in hospital. I caught a bad bacteria due to my  immunity being weak. Lever enzymes is coming down but the antibiotics have slowed the progress. Feeling good but I pee a lot and i can\u2019t hold it. I have the urge i have to go.\nBut radiation treatment is over and now it is a waiting game till I have more scans done.  \nUp date Feb 8th 2025. Still on Lupron shot every 3 months. I go back to see the doctor next Wed. I will talk to him about the once a month shot. I go back to Rad doctor  march 11th for more scans to see where I stand  after radiation.  I feel good. I am trying to eat healthy. I take supplements and Fenben. \nMy sex drive is basically zero. I can still get an erection  but my orgasm  is not strong, but happy I can still perform.  I still get up alot at night to pee. March can\u2019t come quick enough. Last check up a couple of days ago, PSA was .06 and testosterone was 10ng.",

PSMA PET scan on 22nd July 2021 showed potential areas of uptake but undefined.  PSMA PET scan on 23rd September 2021 showed an 8mm right internal iliac/posterior pelvic side wall node which has got an SUV of 3.4.  Started Prostap (ADT) in October for 18 months and finished 37 sessions of radiotherapy to the pelvic lymph nodes and prostate base early March 2022. As of March 2024 latest psa result is >0.01 so ok to date. Minor glyncomastia and just been prescribe tamoxifen 20mg.\nPSA remained at <0.01 then in April 24 rose to 0.03, May 0.05, June  0.07, August  0.53 and  late Aug 1.1.\nPSMA PET scan 15th August 2024, no obvious uptake.\nPSA rose to 36 on 29th November 2024.\nConsultation with Oncologist with report below..\n\nMetachronous metastatic prostate cancer diagnosed with a PSMA PET scan of 27 November 2024 and whole body MRI of 26 November 2024.  PSA on 28 November 2024 was 36.  LFTs shows normal readings with alkaline phosphatase of 47.  PSMA PET scan and MRI scan shows an increase in size of the previously seen left iliac bone lesion that measures 19mm versus 6mm with DWI signal characteristics in keeping with hypercellular bone marrow lesions/metastatic deposit.  Subtle heterogeneity in the signal characteristics within several ribs is unchanged though on the PET scan the SUV has increased in the left anterior 7th rib and right lateral 8th rib.  Whilst the MRI does not suggest these to be bone metastasis the PET scan report says that these might also represent early bone metastasis.  No other suspicious PSMA avid lesions elsewhere.",

I took the anti thyroid medication for around half a year and went into remission and was able to stop taking the medication. Around 3 years later it came back and again a repeat of the anti thyroid medication sorted it out relatively quickly. This pattern repeated every 3 years or so until the last time in 2020 when I decided to go for a total thyroidectomy.  Almost instantly I felt different.  My weight started increasing, my energy levels plummeted and I went from being a very happy person to struggling to find the joy in things.  Over the last year or so things have only deteriorated.  I get a lot of neck and shoulder pain, my cholesterol levels have risen and my hba1c is only just outside of the pre diabetes range.  I am ready to take this into my own hands as I want to feel 'me' again.  I am prescribed 100mcg Levothyroxine by my doctor but it isn't quite enough so have been cutting tablets to make it up to around 110mcg daily. I felt greatly improved on this amount but have recently started Armour Thyroid (2 grains daily) to see if this makes a difference.\n\nAfter trialing Armour and not getting on with taking 2 grains daily (also more would have been needed for optimum results) my private dr has changed me back to Levothyroxine plus 20mcg of T3.",

PCP sent me for a CT of my Prostate and it showed quite a mess of Mets. Next stop the Urologist, biopsy, Gleason 8. Finally got an MO that was highly recommend in early April, 2024, PSA now 54. He immediately scheduled me for a PSMA PET scan in mid April, 2024 and it confirmed, as he so subtilty put it, that I had a 'heavy load' (pelvis, right leg, few ribs, some lymph nodes, etc.). He immediately put me on Orgovyx. Two weeks later Nubeqa. Early May, 2024 we had the discussion about Triplet therapy and I had already done some research on it and agreed, so we started the 6 rounds of Taxotere. It was rather rough, but not dibilitating, I was lucky. My PSA started droping quite impressively, from 54, 43, 10, 5, .75, .44, .28 and on my last round in late August, it was down to .15. After the Taxotere, it went down to .1 in early September, .09 in late September, .14 in late October and today, November 27th, it spiked to 1.05 (all along staying on the Orgovyx and Nubeqa). I had already been scheduled for another PSMA PET for early December to see if their were any 'hotspots', but I was not expecting (or hoping) for such a spike in the PSA. My next appointment with my MO is in 8 days, so I'm trying to speculate what's going on. I'm pretty certain there has to be some 'hotspots' going on, so it looks like perhaps the ADT is not quite keeping things 'at bay'. Anyway, any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm trying not to over-react, but every twitch, tweak or minor discomfort get's be worrying and this big spike in PSA probably has me overthinking this to much. I have just had an appointment with my MO (Dec, 2024) and he is talking about Jevtana and Xofigo.  My recent Guardant 360 test showed I had a mutation that inhibits the Nubeqa from working for me.",

I did not trust the traditional and modern prostate cancer treatments and do not wish to live with all the side effects of those treatments. \n\nMy biopsy came back with 3+4=7 back in 2016. my PSA now is 24. It seems to fluxuate back and forth. Last month it was 18, month before it was 26, month before that it was 17, this month it is 24. I have had bone scans twice every year and at present no sign of matasting anywhere. Last bone scan was October 2022 and came back clean. I have prostate MRI's twice a year, last one was October 2022. Doc says it is still confined to the capsule but there was a swollen lymph note but thats gone now. It is probably gotten outside the prostate but hope not but since there was a swollen lymph note who knows.\n\nI would have tried try the Focal Laser ablation for prostate cancer back in the beginning but insurance did not cover it.  \n\nI was somewhat in control of PSA until I got a kidney stone and had to have it surgically removed and loss control of PSA. Then started Casadex in April 2020 sfter Psa was 119 after the kidney stone, now 24 on Casadex. Started on Casadex April 1, 2021, still on 50mg daily to date. No operations, radiation or chemo to date.\n\nFound out about Fenbendzole and want to learn more about how this can help prostate cancer and possibly cure it. If anyone has been on fenbendazole for prostate cancer and took fenbendazole please let me know about how it has worked for your prostate cancer condition and where you are now since being on fenbendazole. I need to get rid of this disease so I can live a better life but looks luike I'm stuck with it till the end which I hope is 10 or more years away.",

        "bio": "Due to a rough and tumble outdoors life, I have had hip problems for a couple decades. But I have not often gone to the doctor, mostly because I never needed to do so.\n\nThe hip pain got bad in my right hip in 2019 but I figured out how to deal with it. Then this year (2024) in February my left hip started bugging me, beginning with my lower back then settling into my hip.  I couldn't fix it so got a steroid shot in the left hip.\n\nIn May 2024 getting ready for my newly-retired living status, my general MD ordered blood tests. One was the PSA.\n\nI had not had one of those since December 2017 when the PSA was 1.1 and that seemed no big deal. Since then, I have had no problems with peeing or poking, but then the blood test in May 2024 showed my PSA was 17. \n\nSo then in June 2024 a urologist found a 50 g mass during his manual exam of my prostate.\n\nFoolish me, I put off the Fusion-MRI until September and the biopsy until October.\n\nAfter getting what felt like a staple gun up the back end, the results came back with Gleason 9 in late October 2024.\n\nNext was the Ga-68 PSMA PET scan which showed a metastatic bone lesion on my left sit bone (maybe the source of referred hip pain?) and one on a lymph node near my tail bone. So only those two metastases were visible.\n\nSo, November 1, 2024 the young urologist gave his diagnosis: aggressive stage 4 prostate cancer.\n\nIn preparation for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), more blood work showed my PSA had climbed to 32 on November 5, 2024 over six months (from 17 back in May 2024).\n\nNovember 6, 2024 my MO shot me with a 30-day dose of leuprolide. Haven't really noticed any side effects.\n\nThen I started the SBRT aimed at the two metastatic lesions on November 14, 2024 and it ended November 20, 2024, with five sessions in there.\n\nI have cut sugar out of my diet and most carbs and feel great except for that nagging back pain and a weird pain in my elbow....\n\n2024 Dec 2 PSA at 3.21 \nWhy is it not zero after a month on ADT?",

Pharma is in the family.  I have a long established interest in probiotics and the microbiome.\nIn researching hope, I haven't discounted pharma options, although I am aware they are likely to be partial solutions, with very long lead times.  Exanatide and other glp1- receptor agonists are of interest to slow the progression of the disease.  \nI participated in a 2 year trial of a monoclonal alpha-synuclein antibody at Toulouse, which means I did not start conventional medication (pramipexole CR 1.05mg) until March 2020.\nThere seems to be almost universal support for the idea that significant exercise helps (John Peppers website first alerted me to this, but my Carcassone neurologist and Toulouse research neurologist both strongly endorse it, and the NHS web site does likewise).\nStress management and taking an active interest in recovery/therapy also seem universal recommendations.  I am also intrigued by photobiomodulation and believe regular use of a redlight hat is helping.  \nHowever, the more I looked, the more I noticed how much the microbiome was featuring in very recent research papers specifically related to Parkinsons research. I know a bit about the gut brain axis and microbiome generally from my interest in the subject whilst FD of the probiotic company. And I think that area offers the most promise for me taking immediate action whilst I wait for the lumbering mainstream Pharma community to catch up.  And it would appear the microbiome also responds favourably to photobiomodulation.\n\nHence I think Parkinsons is Poo. And fixing the poo may significantly improve PWP",

Then nothing for a few years, then I started checking doors to be sure they were closed or locked in high school. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder in 1992. Then in 1995, I had a very frightening experience. This is when I think the OCD really took over my life. I finally sought treatment in April or May 1998, when the symptoms become overwhelming and daily life was getting very difficult. I had good success with medication and CBT/ERP treatment. However, I have had many periods of minor (never completely symptom free) living interspersed with periods of severe and debilitating symptoms. I have had periods where I get better and then get slowly worse again overtime, and I\u2019ve had periods where I get a trigger or triggers in a short time which cause great distress until I can get back into treatment and back on medications. My story of OCD has been one of never completely defeating it, rather, periods of more or less symptoms and distress. I tend to view OCD similar to something like an addiction. I don\u2019t ever feel like I\u2019ve been \u201ccured\u201d but rather that I must just fight back when I fail and the anxiety and worry and obsession/compulsion cycle starts again. My worries are often a moving target over the years. As a long time sufferer, I\u2019d love to connect with others with this dreaded disease and hopefully we can collectively help each other improve lives and live a more anxiety free life.",

I had a SpaceOAR and fiducial markers installed prior to radiation.\n\nMy T returned to pre treatment level about 2 or 3 months post ADT. As my T rose my PSA rose also. Initially it was <0.01 and my last PSA on 1/06/2025 was 0.09.\n\nIn hindsight I tolerated the ADT and radiation fairly well. Some minor bowel issues and very little SE from the ADT. No residual effects from the radiation. Sex life is normal. \n\nMy radiation was done at my local hospital. I continue to monitor my PSA quarterly. I see my MO quarterly and my RO yearly now. I never have returned to the Urologist. \n\nThroughout and before my treatment I was a daily gym goer. I do resistance work and walk about 6.5 to 7 miles a day. I do resistance work for 30 minutes 6 days a week. During the winter I ski and snow shoe. I use my Apple Watch to track my daily steps and distance. \n\nI have a fairly normal diet and eat three meals a day with minimal snacking. Almost no junk food. I eat limited amounts of meat and love veggies and fruit. Eat a fair amount of whole grains, nuts and yogurt. Drink tea and small amount of milk and eat small amounts of eggs.",

        "bio": "our son seemed to have a traditional path early on. Walking Spelling writing etc all seemed within expectations. He did have separation issues at pre k 3 / 4 but did not need to get picked up early. He did ask for reassurance often possibly small anxiety ( now in hindsight). No social issues, great at sports, coachable and  great teammate. In 6th/7th grade teachers would say he stares into space and often falls off tasks. We saw some of that at home. Vanderbilt tests inconclusive. This was shortly after covid. Migraines started and he would get sick. Would need dark  sleep and rest. His test for absence seizures was negative. He remained active w sports and gym. Bloodwork and drug tests all normal throughout.  Got him a 504 plan because the official diagnoses was made about 1.5 years ago. An IEP followed  and an enhance support classes in school. He does not find any purpose or value of classes like Jewelry Studio, Biology, history, etc though likes to learn via storytelling and experiences (he did have a few months of remote schooling but Psychologists typically do not recommend nor will write a script.  School and state counselers ( in and out of school) did the best they could but some made it worse by forcing us to take him for an evaluation at the hospital    The hospital looks at us wondering why we are even there (several hundred $$ later). He has tried 3-4 different medications like trazadone etc - some made him to jumpy some too tired  we did start to see positive mood changes. He wants to work and had  two jobs at 15 even w his ADHD and poor time mgmt and executive function.  He rarely has bad mood swings. There is no F u\u2019s or fingers to us. We drive him to gym every night. Not a perfect family but we won\u2019t give up on him. Med wise, Now he won\u2019t take anything though continues to workout and does take some supplements for adhd and focus but does want to speak much about it. He won\u2019t really engage w counsellers  we have tried men, women, more passive to the tougher or more direct. \n\nHe did have one mild concussion about 3 .5 years ago and months later was hit by a slowly moving car ( no issues other than bad scrapes and burns, as far as the hospital could tell at that time). We as a family have had some trauma from a bad car accident where the suv flipped over to grandfathers death and a sudden death of a 48 year old uncle. Also about 4 years ago. He has ups and downs with a girlfriend who also has her own challenges.  (Our older son had bad anxiety for about 2 months at a similar age though with outpatient support was fine and is now away in college without medication.)  Our younger guy tried outpatient 1 day and did not like the plan nor the group. \n\nI know that was a ton of info but we just don\u2019t know what to do and as you all know, it has taken its toll on everyone.  Although he started sept and most of October getting up and to school w a friend, now barely goes. We can\u2019t get him into a Magnet trade HS here due to grades. He can\u2019t get another good job until 16 the earliest. We don\u2019t know switching schools would help nor if private schools teachers and staffed are trained for all this.  Even w IEP teachers tell us he has poor time mgmt, no focus etc. we know this and expect it, it\u2019s at the core of ADHD. Sadly we know see why this disorder combo is dangerous and why some never finish HS. We now see what may be posturing and some tick type movements. ( may also be reasons why school is not great - BTW no bullying or issues like that). Although he does not follow instructions well , no teacher said there is any disrespect. \n \n Any suggestions? We can\u2019t physically push  him to school, we don\u2019t want to go back to truancy court ( and judge sees we are doing everything we can) , we see how traditional learning may not work, he does not acknowledge ADHD/ocd so meds, counseling etc are somewhat lacking to cope and manage.",

In the next 24 hours most symptoms retreated! Miracle because the prognosis was poor on arrival in hospital.  I was away from home and I feel the NHS has not managed me moving back to my local hospital/GP.  Seemingly very slow to respond.  12+ weeks wait for ECG, 4weeks wait for a telephone call from the local stroke team.  Medication not reviewed by GP. No follow up to blood screening. So feeling very isolated at the moment.\nFast forward 11 months and my 71st year has been medically the most eventful.  Moving on from the stroke, a dodgy gallbladder and gallstones was found in routine observations, keyhole op went wrong and full abdominal surgery followed with a longer convalescence in November.  And now in February 23 had an implanted heart monitor but although sore is not stopping activity.\nBut positively I found C25K, started running in April 2022 a month after my stroke and have been progressing ever since. Working towards an anniversary run weekend 11/12 March.  Mental health totally improved from above initial entry because of running.\nParkrun 1.47kms 27/1/24 syncope , paramedic to A&E and marked my LINQ ILR when I came round. Ventricular tachycardia event found. Still in hospital pending investigations to determine cause. Echocardiogram and angiogram all clear with EF 65%.  Waiting for Cardio MRI in specialist unit.  MRI showed a scar on my left ventricle, unable to identify a cause for this, but it does explain my LVT and the need for an ICD.  Unfortunately as is normal for me, nothing is straightforward and a lead on my ICD displaced on day one causing me to have to go through the experience again 7 weeks later for a lead revision. However , now nearing the end of May 2024 and everything seems settled. Check up in two weeks!",

We went through tests and found out we both had some potential fertility issues but my AMH levels were good for my age (40 by this point). Got put on the waiting list and opted to do a privately funded round of ivf while waiting for the surgery. Did one round of ivf which I found emotionally tougher than I expected managed to get 6 eggs 4 fertilised using ICSI and two made it to the pronuclear stage and were frozen. About 7 months from the referral I had an open myomectomy and I have been advised I can start trying again after 3 months.",

Am also a person. Being treated at Guy's Hospital. Vlog is at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5BhkLXcyI. After 1st recurrence (self-diagnosed), went alternative as below.\n\nWas taking a huge number of things between 2021 and 2024, mainly from the Joe Tippens Protocol. There are a lot of scam sites related to this so beware. Started this after a recurrence hit me barely three months after given all clear.\n\nCBD oil\nliquid zeolite\nturmeric/curcumin\nsodium bicarb\nmelatonin (10mg x 2 \u2013 have to get it from US)\nfenbendazole (as panacur c) (being used in trials in US)\nzinc\nvitamin d3\nfolic acid\nlow-dose aspirin\nhigh dose vit c\nb complex\napple cider vinegar\n\nbut that was too much to remember and too expensive so now I don't take the CBD oil, liquid zeolite, turmeric/curcumin but have added:\nivermectin (horse dewormer) \u2013 this has had success in OC in non-humans although not my type (clear cell + endometrioid)\ntudca (to counteract any effect the above has on the liver).\n\nMy cancer is back but only after I'd stopped taking much of the above because I'd been cancer-free for three years. I don't know if giving up the alternative meds allowed it to return or if it would have anyway but oncologist seems to think I am already past my sell-by date. I am upping my doses as per Dr Mysister's prescription  to try to stall growth of new lesion.\n\nWas offered another operation (4 hour+) with gamut of attendant risks and more of a similar chemo cocktail and did not want either. Eventually, after putting treatment off for a while, asked re targeted RT as lesion is small and on liver. Now had that (2025) and waiting scan.",

I have diagnosed OCD, stress and anxiety.\nI am currently in the process of being diagnosed with ADHD (more ADD) and I am having to go privately for this diagnosis, as the NHS referral I provided came back negative, despite the fact no one interviewed or met me.  They just came to that conclusion via old school reports.\n\nI have worked all my adult life and I went off long term sick in November 2022 and was subsequently sacked in May 2023 and I've been unemployed ever since.  \n\nLike I said, I have just started private assessments and the doctor I've seen this far has noted potential ADHD and Autism.  The latter has come as a bit of a shock, but my partner determined some time ago that I might be afflicted with that. \nFor me that particular autism is to do with senses - seeing and reacting to things most people don't.  I'm very empathetic and emotional, but I do see patterns everywhere, patterns that affect me and I very much hyperfocus on things.  I believe the ADD causes erratic hyperfocus and hobbies, where they chop and change without warning.\n\nAs a child I would often be disturbed if my routine changed and I struggled very much if I had to wear things like new clothes and if I had to get rid of old clothes.  I'd describe the sensation of wearing something uncomfortable as 'feeling like diarrhea', which is obviously an odd expression.\n\nIf it turns out I do have autism, I don't think it's truly severe, but all the conditions together are having a major impact on me mentally and physically.  I dated a girl with severe Asperger's syndrome and I struggled, as she self-harmed.  I too have a history of suicide attempts.\n\nAt present I am just very confused what to do about things.  I come from a family where maintaining a public face is very important and hiding feelings, emotions and being seen to be 'normal' is very important, but it's a family full of mental health issues.\n\nI'm basically looking for advice, assistance and any help people can give.  I hope my experience can also be of some help and assistance to other people.",

        "bio": "I've been living with anxiety and MDD for about 16 years.  \nI was a regular happy, curious, creative professional. I loved my career, had my hobbies, and loved doing creative things with my kids and watching them grow into little individuals. \nI also have ADHD, non-attentive type and was really naive and clueless about people.\n\nMy ADD makes me more naive than I already am. So I ended up realizing, much too late, that I was in a psychologically and emotionally abusive relationship.  \n\nDuring the last 2 years a lot of bad things confligrated and I ended up with PTSD. My neurochemistry was permanently damaged and it felt like I was going crazy. I couldn't even tell what I was nervous about or crying about.\n\nIt was almost 20 years and I was in love and we had great times together.  During the last five years, a friend called me and I started finding out about cheating, lying and eventually drug addiction. \nWe separated for 2 years, but we had a child together and I didn't want him to have an addict Dad. And maybe I hoped that things could change and we might heal.  \nI forced him to get help through the Marchmant Act, and during treatment things got really bad.  He was really mean, secretive, manipulative, emotionally abusive. I had to get him to move out. \nHe stalked me, hid recorders in the house and in my car, he would call me at night and tell me what I was watching on TV and talking about on the phone. He hid in my back yard and would later call me to tell me whatever he heard and saw me doing.\n\nAt the same time, my Mom was battling cancer and died. My aunt also died and my house was in foreclosure because I am and interior architect and designer and the recession basically stopped any new projects and I had no income for a long time.\n\nThere were other traumatic situations with my older kids, and I was trying to get closure with my Mom about my real Dad (someone other than I was raised to believe) before she passed, but I couldn't.\n\nI started to fall apart, crying all the time.  I was hyper alert and nervous from the stalking. He would show up anytime, anywhere.  \nAt one point, I talked to him, crying and begged him to please stop because I felt like I was breaking inside. He just watched me talking and crying with empty eyes and I knew the hell was not going to end. \n\nHe continued his mental abuse through an unnecessary custody battle, manipulating everything and everyone he could, including my family, trying to make it seem as though I was crazy.  I still have nightmares about him all these years later.\nAt the end of foreclosure, the person who bought my house said they would help me find a rental. And when I got an eviction notice, they said it was just a formality and not to worry.  \nSoon after that a truck pulled up and started putting all my furniture out on the front lawn and stuffing big black garbage bags with my things. My friend called me and I was incoherent, so she called my family to come help.\n\nI've picked up most of the pieces, and tried to do my best for my son, never even told people how bad things were with his Dad to protect him from hearing any gossip. \nMy relationship with my older kids and my sisters has suffered. They don't want to deal with my trauma, anxiety and depression, so they just avoid me.  \nI don't think society is very kind. I don't really want to risk myself in any more relationships, I can't watch the news anymore, and I feel like I'm a shadow of who I used to be.  \nI don't mind solitude, but it's painful not to belong anywhere. I'm becoming less functional, and I don't think I can keep supporting myself. And I wonder how many people have been in my situation, with no way out except going to sleep permanently.",
